This tartan is worn by the present Duke of Argyll, who has approved the sett. The Black Watch is the same sett but dyed in darker shades.

"" where they wrote: ""Down till a very recent period, this pattern was generally worn by the Clergy in the Highlands for their weekday habiliments; and even now the secular mantle or plaid of the priesthood in the North is not unfrequently made of this, or similar kinds of stuff."" Although they seem to speak with the voice of authority, there is still debate on the matter although the following gives further credibility: ""It is well known that in earlier times the Highland clergy wore the Highland dress and carried arms. Many attempts were made to prevent them wearing tartan and to force them to wear conventional ministerial habit. These, however, had only limited success."" The SCALAN Catholic college in Glenlivet which operated in the late 1700s has reference in its 1780 accounts to buying tartan but of course there is no way of knowing if that was a plain tartan or the Clergy tartan as shown here since the word tartan was used for a type of cloth as well as for cloth woven with a tartan pattern. The Clergy tartan is sometimes called ""The Priest's Sett"", but in the Highlands is known as ""Breacan nan Cleirach"" - the tartan of the Clergy. As with so very many tartans, there are many variations of the Clergy sett, due to the vagaries of the illustrators of tartan books.

The designer of this tartan was Hugh Kirkwood Rankine who was born in Winnipeg of Scottish parents. It's said that during a leave in Scotland during World War II, he became interested in tartan and on his return learned how to weave and in time produced this 'history in cloth' which was given Royal Assent in 1962. The red squares represent the Red River Settlement; the green squares signify the natural resources of the province; the azure blue squares represent Lord Selkirk, the founder of the Red River Settlement and the dark green lines are for Manitoba's multi cultural population. In his 'District Tartans' book, Gordon Teal states that sometimes the tartan is depicted with the dark green as red. This, he said, is an example of the errors that can be caused by the Lord Lyon's use of heraldic colours to describe tartans. In heraldry G, gules, is red, whereas G in conventional tartan terminology is green. Recorded in Lyon Court Book No 14. 5th April 1962.

In their 1850 book ""The Clan and Family Tartans of Scotland"" William and Andrew Smith of Mauchline wrote: The pattern here given seems to be universally considered the genuine Buchanan Tartan and we know that it is worn by Archibald Buchanan Esq, of Catrinebank, Ayrshire, whose father's name is identified with one of the first cotton manufactories established in Scotland with Arkwright's improvements.""

He then went on to relate that he had been shown - by Mrs Stuart of Dalness - a remarkable example of the old belted plaid, 'of a design differing from the above in certain particulars but having the same dominant features. It is reported to be two centuries old, and to represent the original sett of the tartan.'

It appeared in Wilson's pattern book of 1819, in Grant No: 15 and in William and Andrew Smith's 1850 ""Authenticated Tartans of the Clans and Families of Scotland"" where they wrote: ""The correctness of the Forbes Tartan here given, seems to be, in the opinion of the Trade, a matter beyond the slightest doubt: it was once worn by the 74th regiment, but that corps now wear the Lamont."" The Lamont is the same as the Forbes but minus the black guards on the white. A different Forbes sett was approved by the Clan Chief and registered with Lord Lyon in November 1949. Known as Forbes Ancient - see # 212 - there is modern doubt as to its accuracy and it is surmised that an error has been made in recording it in the Lord Lyon's book - investigation continues (Jan 2008). Today's Forbes is also worn by the Liverpool Scottish. The Liverpool Scottish was formed as an infantry battalion in 1900 in response to the crisis of the Boer War. It was raised from amongst the body of highly educated and professional young Scotsmen in the city as the 8th (Scottish) Volunteer Battalion, The King's (Liverpool Regiment). There was an annual subscription of 10 shillings (50p) and an entrance fee of 2.GBP. The first Commanding Officer was Colonel C. Forbes Bell V.D. The Forbes tartan kilt was adopted by the regiment and the Highland full dress uniform featured a khaki tunic with scarlet collar and facings together with a feather bonnet or glengarry and tartan plaid. The earliest known date from a list compiled by D C Stewart from Wilsons of Bannockburn letters is 1827.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/211/"

The Lord Lyon of the time apparently exploded when the tartan was submitted to him and is quoted as saying ""We don't record tartans for submarines. It is nonsense. I have never heard of a ship's tartan in the whole history of Scotland!"". While not necessarily tartan-related, mention should also be made of Mission Specialist Laurel Clark, who was killed in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003. Clark, a Naval Doctor, was stationed at the US Navy submarine base at Holy Loch, Scotland with Submarine Squadron (SUBRON 14). According to a number of accounts, she was very proud of her Scottish heritage, and a piper played at her wedding to a fellow naval officer she had met at Holy Loch. On the morning before the tragic accident, Mission Control used Scotland the Brave as the wakeup call for Columbia in honor of Clark. The well-known pipe tune was also played at her funeral, along with Amazing Grace at Arlington National Cemetery. The Polaris (Military) tartan (ITI #222) is worn today by the Pipes and Drums of the US Naval Academy.

Actually, Wilsons merely took Black Watch and changed the black to red as mentioned above. STS Notes: The 'Black Watch' has provided the base for many of the Clan tartans. Wilson had a monopoly to supply tartans for the regiments during the period when tartan was proscribed for (male) highlanders not possessing land...

(No. 417, The Highland Textile, 1990). Colours from Kilbarchan samples range from Balmoral blue to med blue..","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/430/"

However, the changing of what may have been recognised for quite some years as a tartan for Browns, could 'disenfranchise' all those Browns who have purchased the dark blue version and is to be avoided if at all possible.

Notes (May 2006) from Sir Malcom MacGregor of MacGregor, Chief of Clan MacGregor explains that the MacGregor of Deeside and the MacGregor of Glengyle are really one and the same. He has a specimen of this tartan (BLACK and red) which his grandfather obtained from Skeoch Cumming in 1922, who got it from an old woman in Nairn who said it was the tartan of the MacGregors of Glengyle whence her people came. The Chief said ""My father believed this to be correct, bearing in mind the history of the MacGregors of Deeside. The MacGregors transported to Aberdeenshire by the Earl of Moray who came from his estates in Menteith to fight the Mackintoshes in about 1624, were almost certainly MacGregors of Glengyle and would have worn that tartan. Another specimen of this sett is in the possession of Andersons of Edinburgh, believed to date from 1750. It is in red and blue colours as opposed to red and black.

It was reported that the later variation of this tartan (Maine Dirigo #3068) from the St. Andrew's Society of Maine had been adopted as the official State of Maine Tartan in January 2001 but subsequent information indicated that it had not been considered until Feb. 13th of that year and the recommendation had been that 'it ought not to pass' . . . . and it didn't. There is thus NO OFFICIAL STATE OF MAINE TARTAN although this version here (502) probably has the best claim to the title of the Official Unofficial Maine Tartan. August 2013: Maine Tartan and Tweed Co. were selling this as the Maine State Tartan but now state that they are discontinuing it - probably in favour of thier own 'Maine Arcadia tartan as registered at 10292.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/502/"

Extract from 'People's Journal' of Saturday 5th March 1949 talking of the Tillicoultry weavers J & D Paton. ""An entry from the nineteenth century shows a scrap of largely blue and red tartan with the thread count falling in sevens, entitled 'The 7th Cavalry Tartan'. No British military formation has such a name, although there was an American 7th Cavalry, which achieved fame under General Custer at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, (June 25 and June 26, 1876, near the Little Bighorn River in the eastern Montana Territory) where it was massacred by the Sioux Indians. Apparently, General Custer had a liking for military bands and formed ad hoc brass and bagpipe bands. It is probable that the 7th Cavalry wrote to Scotland to commission a tartan for their pipers and drummers, since the regiment contained many Americans of Scottish descent."" It was said that at one time the threadcount was divisible by 7 but that is not the case now. In May 2006 the woven sample from the Paton Collection was checked and the threadcount entered here. Warp and weft were different which produced a rectangular block of dark blue.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/644/"

Originally named 'Scott of Buccleuch' in recognition of the Duke of Bucccleuch's (family name 'Scott') long association with the Regiment. At the end of World War I, the 'overbearing' General Haig returned to the Scottish Borders and - allegedly in an acrimonious dispute - replaced Waldie Griffiths as 'Colonel' of the Regiment. It's reported that the Haigs and Buccleuchs were traditionally at 'daggers drawn'. It's possible that Haig may have been responsible for deliberately dropping the 'Scott' portion of the tartan name as part of the 'feud' but it was not authorised by the Regiment and for many years it was just known as 'Buccleuch' - until 2015 when the STA reinstated the original name.. At some stage this design - with the black bands reduced to six - became known as the 'Haig' - possibly because of its adoption by that family. Another name attached to it is 'Gladstone' which might have been connected with Gladstone's the textile 'finishers' from Galashiels.

The Bannockbane proved to be an exceptionally successful addition to modern tartan collections, which although originally produced as a fashion check, is now generally considered to have earned it's place as a Scottish tartan.

Columbia, after the river of the same name, was the traditional name for the south of the colony. The tartan was designed by Earl K Ward of Victoria in 1967 as part of the 1966-67 centennial celebrations marking the merger of the two colonies of British Columbia and Vancouver Island into a single colony. In 1974 it was officially adopted as the provincial tartan. The Pacific Dogwood is the official flower of the province and is represented by white in the tartan. Green is for the BC forests which cover an area twice as big as all of the New England states and New York State.

Authenticated by specimens of contemporary and immediately subsequent dates - invariably bearing the legend of royal adoption - the tartan may be ranked amongst the earliest clan patterns extant in fabric. It is undoubtedly an old pattern of the MacRaes; and it was certainly worn by the Prince in their territory.

The following is from THE SCOTTISH REGIMENTS, 2nd edition, by Dr. Diana Henderson. HarperCollins Publishers, 1996:- ""The 79th (Cameron of Erracht) Tartan was unique among Scottish Regiments owing to the fact that it was not derived from the 42nd Government (Black Watch) Tartan. It was created by taking the Macdonald sett, omitting three red lines, and imposing the yellow line of clan Cameron. Tartan flashes used as badge backings and sleeve flashes were typically taken from the intersection of the yellow lines. ""The 79th tartan was a source of jealously guarded pride to the Cameron Highlanders. In 1881, when the linking of battalions was taking place, the War Office considered linking the 42nd Royal Highlanders with the 79th Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders. The problem was that both regiments would have to wear the same tartan and obviously the 42nd had precedence. The Camerons were asked by telegram, 'Will your regiment adopt tartan of the 42nd Regiment?' Risking disbandment or amalgamation, the curt reply in the negative left the War Office in no doubt that no one interferes with the 79th tartan.""","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/993/"

It was claimed that the official Morrison clan tartan was recorded by Lord Lyon on 3rd January 1968, from a piece of tartan found in an old Morrison family bible. The bible contained a hand written reference to the tartan and was dated 1747, one year after the proscription of Highland dress. The discovery was made during the demolition of a Black House on Lewis in 1935. Lord Lyon was convinced that it represented the most authentic pattern of what the Morrisons wore in those days and he based the new tartan on the relic. The sample in the STA Dalgety Collection was woven by Lochcarron and is labelled (16th March 1972) ""Enclosed pattern of the NEW Clan Morrison tartan woven from the sett provided by the Clan Secretary about the end of 1968 and made for the Morrison Clan. The Green one is now officially known as the Society Morrison."" There is no 'green Morrison' as such unless that refers to the Morrison Hunting (#1083). 2. #993 is the original Morrison clan tartan but the reason that #998 is now regarded as such is said to be as follows: Colonel Morrison, wishing to re-establish his tartan - his old pre-1939 kilt had been destroyed in a London air-raid - made an error by centring ONE green line instead of TWO on the red band. When this was later brought to the attention of Sir Thomas Innes of Learney (Lord Lyon) by Stuart Davidson in 1967 he refused to alter what had been registered in Lyon Court Books and remarked that the Morrisons would just have to accept it.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/998/"

The blue guards on the black started out life as being azure but over the decades became darker and darker. This is a variation of Black Douglas (#1029) with white instead of red. Lochcarron swatch. ""The Cameronians did not wear tartan until 1881 when, in common with other Lowland regiments, they adopted the Government, or Black Watch, tartan. It was only in 1891 that the regiment was authorised to wear the Douglas tartan, which was taken into use the following year. The use of the Douglas tartan reflects the origins of the 26th Cameronian Regiment. In 1881, when the regiment was designated a rifle regiment, the officers and men were clothed in the distinctive Rifle Green cloth with bands of black thistle lace on the shako and black cords. The pipers of the regiment also wore the Douglas tartan. "" The above comes from: http://www.cameronians.org/uniform-tartan-badge/index.html STS notes: Wilson's sent a list of tartans to Logan about 1830 stating that 'No 148' had been sold as Douglas for a 'considerable' time. Logan included the Douglas tartan even though he said that no family tartans appeared in his book. The distinction between clans and families is obscure. There are many historic references to the 'Border Clans' which would certainly describe the Douglas'. There is also a black and grey sett (#1127) for the clan which first appeared in the Vestiarium Scoticum in 1842. Lochcarron sample. Marton Mills produced (2001?) a copy of this and called it 'Bath' - #6006. In the original tartan, the green and blue were so dark that it is almost impossible to see the lines crossing the greens.

""Dunedin"" is an alternative (or lyrical) form of Edinburgh used by towns in these countries.

None had success until the design by Councillor Hugh Macpherson in 1970 on the occasion of the Commonwealth Games. The colours have symbolic references to the City of Edinburgh.

A comparison of both, certainly confirms this claim and it would tie in with Hugh MacPherson's modus operandi in that he did not (to our knowledge as at 2006) produce any original designs but merely changed the colours in a host of clan tartans and renamed them 'dance' or 'dress'.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/1163/"

These, however, had only limited success. The Clergy tartan is sometimes called ""The Priest's Sett"", but in the Highlands is known as ""Breacan nan Cleirach"" - the tartan of the Clergy. As with so very many tartans, there are many variations of the Clergy sett, due to the vagaries of the illustrators of tartan books. There is no categorisation for occupational tartans so all the clergy tartans are classed as ""Corporate"". This is woven by Lochcarron and sold as Clergy. The same sett but with the first pivot (Black8) changed to Blue8 and with the light grey changed to white is sold as Clark (#633). Willie Scobie writes: ""That tartan was worn by the clergy of mediaeval Scotland is almost beyond doubt. The following reference may verify this ""1549: The clergy wear only round birettas and shall always take off their caps in churches, especially in choirs and in time of divine service and not dress, as for example, in top-boots and double-breasted or oddly-cut coats, or of forbidden colours, as yellow, green and such kinds of parti-colour. ""(Provincial Council of Prelates and Clergy: Edinburgh) That there was an instruction prohibiting such garb suggests that it was, in fact, being worn, and 'parti-colour' was often an expression which referred to tartan. We also have clearer evidence that the Presbyterian leaders of Scotland?s Reformed Kirk frowned on the wearing of tartan by its ministers 1575: ""We think unseemly all using of plaids in the Kirk by readers and ministers.""

As early as 1760 the Duke of Northumberland (Percy family) designated this tartan for his personal piper.

The SCALAN Catholic college in Glenlivet which operated in the late 1700s has reference in its 1780 accounts to buying tartan but of course there is no way of knowing if that was a plain tartan or the Clergy tartan as shown here since the word tartan was used for a type of cloth as well as for cloth woven with a tartan pattern. The Clergy tartan is sometimes called ""The Priest's Sett"", but in the Highlands is known as ""Breacan nan Cleirach"" - the tartan of the Clergy. As with so very many tartans, there are many variations of the Clergy sett, due to the vagaries of the illustrators of tartan books.

Its creation was sparked in the early 1940s by Group Captain E.G. Fullerton AFC, Commanding Officer of No. 9 Service Flying Training School and later Commanding Officer of RCAF Station Trenton."" At that time the Edinburgh company of Wm Anderson (now Kinloch Anderson Ltd) had substantial military business in Canada and Mr Kinloch Anderson was apparently asked to design a tartan for the RCAF. That he did - based on the Anderson tartan - and it's thought that the Loomcrofters of Gagetown in New Brunswick, Canada may have woven some prototype samples which possibly has given rise to the claim that they designed the tartan. After modification by the Air Council, the design received official sanction from Air Force Headquarters on 21 May 1942. The tartan was submitted to Lord Lyon, King of Arms in Edinburgh for approval in July 1942. In reality he had no power to approve or disapprove and he merely 'noted' its existance although it's frequently and erroneously claimed that he granted approval on 15 August 1942 and it became officially known worldwide as The Royal Canadian Air Force Tartan. With the amalgamation of Canada's three military services in 1968, the distinctive blue Air Force uniform was lost for over 20 years. This was a time of profound change for Canada's military, when unit titles, insignia, and all distinguishing hallmarks of the Army, Navy, and Air Force were officially proscribed in favour of a singular, generic-looking force. In hindsight, it is incredible that the RCAF Tartan survived, for amid the post-integration haste for uniformity, precious swatches of the original tartan samples were incinerated, and its official documentation hung in oblivion. Thanks to the prudence of the RCAF Association, a piece of Air Force - indeed national - heritage was carefully preserved. Today, as much as ever, its colours reflect the mettle of a proud, professional Service. Designed by Mr W.J. Kinloch Anderson of Kinloch Anderson Ltd and based on the Anderson tartan. Originally woven by Peter MacArthur. STS comments ""The threadcount was provided by M. Lawrence of the Canadian Defence Department in Ottawa. Colours specified as dark blue, light blue and maroon. The orignal thread count was: M4, A6, K1, M2, K1, A14, K3, W3, K2, M2, K2, M2, DB4, M2, DB6, M2, DB6, M3. It is unusual to have a single strand used in a thread count as it is impossible to turn the thread on the 'kilt edge'. The following is from D C Stewart's NOMINDEX ""No RCAF tartan is registered with the Lyon Court but a letter exists in which Lyon acknowledges letter with details from the RCAF and merely comments that he had 'noted' it. This caused much confusion and gave rise to the strong rumour that Lyon (Sir Francis Grant) had 'registered' the tartan. The specimen in the Scottish United Services Museum is claimed to have been 'approved' by Lord Lyon - this is not the case."" For display purposes the count has been doubled in this graphic. ""Of the original Anderson tartan (#1394) James D Scarlett MBE noted in his 1975 book ""The Tartans of the Scottish Clans"" : The origin of this tartan is unknown, but the type of pattern suggests that it had its basis in one of the 'fancy' types of design that were becoming popular in the few years immediately preceding the great 'tartan explosion' that was touched off by the 1822 royal visit to Edinburgh. There was a ready sale for such patterns in the days when they could be worn for reasons of preference, and several of them, the Anderson among them, passed to posterity as clan tartans.""","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/1343/"

Sometimes it is woven with a small stripe of green, bisecting the broad red belt; but we know that this green stripe is a modern innovation, and therefore we exclude it having the best authority for doing so."" The green line version is probably Stewart of Rothesay at #848 and the Vestiarium entry at #846. Theoretically this cannot be used or worn without the express permission of HM The Queen. In pratice however, this is the most popular tartan ever woven and can be seen on a huge range of products. The genie is well and truly out of the bottle so the theory rather evaporates. The pattern was first published by James Logan in his book, 'The Scottish Gael' in 1831, but references indicate that the sett was known at the end of the 18th century and a slightly different version of it was reputed to have been worn by one of Bonnie Prince Charlie's followers in the 1745 rebellion. Early samples show blue as a light 'azure'. In James Cant MA's manuscript book of 450+ hand-painted colour strips, someone (presumably Jack Dalgety who inherited the book) has written "" ?? har (n)dspun sett dated pre 1689 . . ."" Jamie Scarlett (March 2008) said that this was labelled 'Royal Bruce' in the Moy Hall collection dated to 1820 - 1850.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/1370/"

Lord Lovat, Simon Christopher Joseph Fraser, was reported to have not given any heed to the decision, dismissing the matter as being beneath him.[25] Since this decree, there has been much confusion as to who is the Chief of the Clan Fraser. Many believe that this decree made the Lady Saltoun the chief of the Clan. However, the Lord Lyon did not grant the chiefship of the Clan Fraser, just a description of ""Chief of the name and arms."" The Lord Lyon does not have power over the Chief of a Highland Clan. What the decree did was reinforce the Lady Saltoun's claim to being the head of the senior branch of the wider Fraser family, and granted her the use of the plain and undifferenced Fraser arms (three strawberry flowers on a field of blue).The current Lord Lovat, Simon Fraser retains the chiefship. STS notes state: Early references include Wilson's of Bannockburn, but Wilson did not name the sett. D W Stewart contends that this is in fact an early Grant tartan which he traced to a portrait of Robert Grant of Lurg (1678-1771), hanging at Troup House before it was closed around 1894. An early Kilbarchan sample has the green and blue so dark as to appear black which produces a quite different tartan. A claim by the Smiths is not the same as proof. There is no 'evidence' of this sett exisiting prior to the rough date of the Sobieskies' Cromarty Mss. PEM Dec 10.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/1424/"

However in 1992, Lord Lyon, about to recognize a chief of Clan Bell decreed that it was desirable to reserve the name ""Blackethouse"" for the Chief. Accordingly ""Bell of Blackethouse"" was renamed ""Border Bell"" In the STS records however it was further renamed (reportedly on the instructions of Col. W.Bell mentioned above) 'Southern Bell' without any consultation with the Scottish Bell Society who regarded - and still regard it - as their official tartan. To recap, this Bell here (1489) is 'Bell of the Borders' and has a US lineage. No 370 is Border Bell and has a Scottish lineage.

He related that he had been approached by a friend from 'The Scotsman' newspaper with the suggestion that he create a Robert Burns tartan. The first idea had been to base it on the Campbell - a clan with which the Burns family were connected - but after much discussion it was decided more appropriate to model it on the Shepherd's Check. The overcheck introduced 'the hodden grey and a' that' and a little flavour of green fields was added. There was thought of calling it the 'Ayr Tartan' but that was discarded in favour of the present name which more aptly celebrated the bicentenary of the poet's birth. Count increased by 50% for clarity which explains the DG9. In June 1959 the Burns Federation accepted the design with the condition that all goods should be made in Scotland.

However, the real story as related by Jan Crook in July 2003 is that she wove a sash in July 1992 based on a piece of tartan given to her by a Bill Fitzpatrick of 14252 Campagna Way, Watsonville, CA 95076. The sample was said to have come from Pendelton Woollen Mills of Oregon who had apparently woven it and who gave their permission to Jan to weave the sash. Apparently Bill Fitzpatrick then registered the tartan as Fitzpatrick with TECA on January 1992. Close resemblance to Royal Stewart. The Irish Tartan book was probably Clans Originaux which has long - and erroneously - been held to contain about a dozen Irish tartans. Study of the contents pages by the STA in 2003 showed that there is no Fitzpatrick in it or any other tartans that could be construed as Irish. Research continues to track down the source of this - apparently - false attribution.

The Smith's sources included the findings of George Hunter, an army clothier who toured the Highlands in search of old tartans prior to 1822. The Jacobite tartan has been known since the Union of 1707 and was worn by participants in the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 and is associated with the Scots national identity. It is often worn by those with no clan connections as an alternative to a district tartan. Smith of Mauchline tells us that this pattern was taken from a scarf made in 1712 and James Grant wrote ""Doutbless it was adopted and worn as a symbol to others of secret political opinions . . ."" DC Stewart adds: ""It seems very odd that so striking a design should have been used for such a purpose, but the Jacobites were never notable for discretion . . . the story of its early associations might well be insufficient to overcome a forgivable diffidence in the prospective wearer of this as a kilt tartan.""

Named in honour of King George III who was from the House of Brunswick, this Atlantic seaboard province acquired its own official tartan in 1959. The design came from the Loomcrofters company in Gagetown - a pretty village on the Saint John River. The colours are forest green for the lumbering; meadow green for agriculture; blue for the coastal and inland waters and an interweaving of gold, symbol of the province's potential wealth. The red blocks signify the loyalty and devotion of the early Loyalist settlers and the New Brunswick Regiment. Another observer adds that the brown band commemorates the 'beaver' from Lord Beaverbrook the press baron who commissioned the first weaving. Although not born there, he published his first newspaper in the Province at the age of 13 and always regarded it as home. The tartan was entered in the Lord Lyon's books but in such a complicated form as to be incomprehensible. The verbal description given in the CIDD reads as follows: ""the first block having four outer corners coloured forest green, four squares of shepherd's check in the centre of the block woven of meadow green and forest green, and being separated from each other and from the forest green in the outer corners of the first block by three stripes each woven of azure blue and gold.; the second block having a red background with stripes of brown, azure blue, gold and grey; ""","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/1880/"

The colors which are said to reflect the seasons of the year are muted vegetable colours which merge peacefully and harmoniously together. It is obtainable from several manufacturers, but perhaps its price is higher than other tartans because of the difficulties in settingup the loom with so many colours.

Apparently they wore this with great pride in their annual march past the Cenotaph in London for the Remembrance Parade. After quite a bit of lobbying of the Ministry of Defence (especially by the past Commanding Officer of RAF Leuchars in Fife, Air Commdore Jack Haines) the Air Force Board accepted - in 2002 - the tartan as the official Royal Air Force tartan and authorised a change of name. The RAF Ceremonial Office at Bentley Priory (old RAF Fighter Command HQ) is now (2002) seeking sponsorship to equip the four or five RAF pipe bands with the tartan.

In their 1850 book ""The Clan and Family Tartans of Scotland"" William and Andrew Smith of Mauchline wrote: ""This Tartan is sometimes woven with only one shade of blue, but this is done merely to save trouble; the oldest pattern which we have been able to procure has two shades of that colour, as we have given it."" STS entry: The pattern is recorded by W and A Smith in 1850 and by Grant in 1886. Logan (1831) gives a variation with a single azure stripe, but the earlier sample in the Cockburn Collection (1810-15) indicates that in this instance, Logan was wrong. There is a curious mathematical similarity with the Royal Stewart tartan in which the number of threads and the colours have been reversed.

That tartan was illustrated in the Smith & Teale 'District Tartans' book and a woven swatch from Fraser & Kirkbright is in the STA's archives. The tartan was recorded in the Lyon Court books (Edinburgh, 24th October 1984) with two pivots as if it were a symmetrical one - one assumes that that was an error. A Yukon Tartan Act was passed by the Yukon Legislature on November 29, 1984 and the tartan was adopted as the Yukon State Tartan. By September 2002 however, the design was changed by simply mirroring it and a second Tartan Act was implemented. Yukon Government site notes read ""The Yukon tartan is a recent and non-traditional addition to the world's official tartans. The woven cloth is composed of stripes of green, dark blue, magenta, yellow and white in varying widths on a light blue background. The crystalline blue background represents the Yukon sky while the green symbolizes the territory's forests. White is used to symbolize snow, and yellow to reflect the Yukon's gold. Magenta is the colour of fireweed, the Yukon's floral emblem, and dark blue represents the mountains. The Yukon tartan was designed by Janet Couture of Watson Lake in 1965 and was first proposed as the official territorial tartan during the 1967 Canadian centennial celebrations. However, it was rejected by both the Yukon legislature and the official Scottish tartan registry at the time. It was not approved by either until 1984. Members of the 1967 Territorial Council rejected the tartan because they were concerned about the legal implications of a private individual holding the copyright for the design. The tartan registry rejected the design because it was, in fact, a plaid and did not meet official tartan specifications. In a plaid, the stripes are woven in a repeating sequence, while in a tartan the stripe sequence is reversed - a definition that has long been discarded. .","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/2129/"

It is a direct link back to the Roman occupation of the area around 250 A.D.and was found stuffed into a pot filled with over 2000 silver coins. This early Celtic tweed used undyed yarn to give a herringbone pattern in brown hues and is considered to be a ""poor man's plaid"". The Falkirk District Tartan is alive with vibrant colour to reflect that part of Scotland as it is seen today. It was the winning entry by Jim McGeorge (aided by Tony Murray of Stirling) in a public competition run by Falkirk Town Centre Management to create a new image for an area that was rising from the ashes of its former industrial glory. Brown - represents the dominant colour of the original cloth; blue - links Falkirk district with sea via the River Forth and the canals. It is also the colour of the Falkirk ""Bairns."" Red - is the colour of the blast furnace flames from the Falkirk foundries and yellow - signifies wealth and prosperity. Black - the black lines intersect on blue to show Falkirk at the crossroads of all roads through the region.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/2347/"

The reason for that is obvious when 'Thomson's Fancy' is viewed - it just has azure in place of the white shown here. Whilst this Thomson Camel here has the red stripe in the same position as Burberry, the white stripes are much further apart and have a white line between them. Close up, there is no problem in distinguishing between this and the genuine Burberry. Lochcarron substitutes blue for the two narrow black lines. Lochcarron swatch. Another opinion suggests that this was designed by Laird Portch.

It started life in 1988 as a new design from Strathmore and proved popular with one particular customer called Jane - for whom Strathmore made skirts in the tartan. Just like their predecessors, Wilson's of Bannockburn back in the 18th & 19th century, Strathmore gave the tartan an unofficial name - 'Lady Jane of St Cirus' - a small beachside settlement north of Montrose. Another of their customers was Robert Kulyn, proprietor of the Tartan House in Tipp City, Ohio and he showed the Lady Jane to members of the Band who like it sufficiently to adopt it.

The colours depicted within the 'sett' of the Victoria State Tartan are historically linked with the armorial bearings for the State of Victoria. Design rationale: DARK BLUE - Represents the blue azure of the shield on the Victoria Coat of Arms and the background of the Victorian State flag originating from the British Blue Ensign. WHITE - The five white stripes within the tartan represents the five white stars of the constellation of the Southern Cross unique to the Southern Hemisphere and attached on the shield in the Victorian Coat of Arms from 1870. GREEN - Represents the live branch the grassy mount on which the two female figures stand which supports the motto for the State,"" Peace and Prosperity"". PINK - Represents the State floral emblem of Victoria, the Common Pink Heath adopted in 1958.

Tartan was gift of Lady MacDonald of Borrodale to Prince Charles Edward 1746. Following explanation from the Kirkliston Pipe Band site who use the tartan: ""After the Battle of Culloden on 16th April 1746, Prince Charles Edward Stuart was a fugitive in the West Highlands until rescued by French ships in Arisaig on 20th September. His escape took him into the 'safe' Clanranald territory of Morar, Arisaig and Moidart. He was sheltered by Angus and Catriona MacDonald of Borrodale. Six days later the Prince, four companions, Donald MacLeod and seven Clanranalds, sailed for the Outer Hebrides in an eight-oared boat of the Borrodales. As soon as they were clear of the sheltered waters of the sea loch at Arisaig, a violent storm arose. Driven by the gale through the night and in constant danger of capsizing, the boat reached Benbecula where the Prince, his companions and crew hid for two days. They then sailed to Scalpay off Harris where they were hospitably received by Donald Campbell a tenant of MacLeod of Dunvegan, and where the Prince was given a change of clothes. On departure, he left the sea-soaked tartan lately given to him by Lady Borrodale, with Donald Campbell and his family. Two fragments of this tartan cloth are known to have survived. One in the West Highland Museum, Fort William, and the other among a collection of Stuart relics at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire. The pieces were brought together by Peter MacDonald, Handloom Weaver, Crieff, who reconstructed the original tartan, using dyes to match the original colours of indigo blue and cochineal red. The research to authenticate the history of the tartan, was carried out by Mr Tom Massey Lynch on behalf of Stonyhurst College, and the recreated tartan was displayed in the Royal Museum of Scotland by courtesy of the Trustees of the College.

To create the contemporary Stirling tartan, Stewart Russell (a researcher at Stirling Council) set about photographing indigenous plants and flowers in the Stirling area - plants at the foot of the Wallace Monument including thistles, fox gloves, wild nettles and heather. The photos were then scanned into a computer and digitalised to create patterns and individual colour palettes. This visual information was then applied to a computer programme written specifically for designing tartan. Two sets of images were produced - some symmetrical and some asymmetrical. The asymmetrical patterns were said to have been based on original designs found in the Wilson's ""Key Pattern Book"" of 1819."" Apparently this design process was not without its problems and Stewart then took the project to Annie Stewart of Anta who designed the tartan as it is today.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/2686/"

A tartan to help raise money for the British Antarctic Survey, a government organisation for scientific study, and the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, a charity which conserves the Antarctic base of Scott, Shackleton etc. It was launched on 5th May 2000 at the Chedral Flower mart in Washington DC. ""White represents the ice-covered continent, ice flows, and the edge of the Antarctic Ocean. Grey represents outcropping rocks, seals and birds. Orange represents lichen, Emperor and King penguin (head) plumage. Yellow also represents penguin plumage and the summer midnight sun. Black and white together depict penguins and whales. Pale blue represents crevasses in the ice and shallow blue icy waters on the ice shelves, whilst dark midnight blue represents the deep Antarctic Ocean and the darkness of the Antarctic winter. The design is based upon the Antarctic?s geography. The light square of white at the edge of the sett represents the light of the Antarctic summer on the ice-covered continent. This is quartered by threads of pale blue. These represent the zero / 360, 90, 180, and 270 lines of longitude. The point where they cross represents the South Pole. Two bands of grey surrounding the white heart depicts nunataks, mountain ranges, and exposed coastal rocks. Around the coast Antarctica?s life forms are found so the colours that follow in the sett, orange, yellow, black and white, represent the wealth of animal life on land and in the seas. Orange also represents the lichens that encrust the rocks. Surrounding the land, pale blue and white depict the ice shelves whilst the outside is edged by bands of midnight blue for the ocean deeps and dark winters. Each sett is separated by a thin band of white that represents the edge of Antarctica. Where these cross, the Southern Cross is depicted. This viewed diagonally also represents the Scottish saltire, tribute that 2001 is the centenary of Scott?s first expedition to the Antarctic in 1901.

They contacted state officials, who after research, could find no record of the original Maine tartan ever having been officially adopted. So a move was put forward to have the new Maine Dirigo tartan adopted as the official tartan of the state. The STA was subsequently led to believe that it was ""adopted as the state tartan on 15th January 2001 in State House, Augusta, Maine."" However, further research in 2007 showed that this was incorrect and although it may have been submitted on that date, a decision was not formally made until February 13 of that year, and that decision was ""Ought Not to Pass."" We thus have the situation where there are two contenders for the position of Maine Tartan and neither have been approved by the state legislators. The State of Maine tartan copyright holders are insistent that theirs is official and it does appear on some websites as one of the State's many official symbols . . . but the facts now suggest otherwise.

That's thought to be an error in recreating the 'ancient' sett by adapting/copying a modern weaving of the tartan (D C Dalgliesh of Selkirk) in its unfaded colours which was in itself inaccurate. That's the version shown here. Somehow an extra green block (G18) had been inserted into the threadcount in one area and a G3 omitted in another. The tartan came from the kilt outfit donated to the Scottish Tartans Museum in Franklin, North Carolina on 16th October 2003 by Frances Swanson. The kilt had been seen back in the 1980s but had disappeared from sight and there was confusion over the count and the colours at the time.

Charlie then re-categorised this one as the Dress version and had the new one at 7538 designed.

The Tartan was designed by Arthur Mackie, former mill manager, in co-operation with Lieutenant Lee Josselyn who served with a detachment of SeaBees at RAF Edzell in Scotland in the early 1990?s. Lee Josselyn?s enthusiasm introduced the concept of wearing tartan to many US servicemen and their families connected with the SeaBees. The Tartan is made up of the following colour combinations which reflect the SeaBee code of conduct: Dark Blue Stripe - The Navy we proudly serve; Light Blue Stripe - The Oceans we?ve crossed; Brown Stripe - The Mountains we?ve moved; Red Stripe - The Blood nobly shed; Yellow Cross check - The Twinkle in every SeaBee's eye. It should be noted that this tartan has no formal US Military recognition, but through common usage has become widely accepted as a representative design.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/3838/"

House Joint Resolution 97-1016 described the colour symbolism: ""The crispness of the color blue captures the beauty of the clear Colorado skies and the coolness of forest green renders images of pine and spruce that grace the mountains with dignity . . . . the contrasting colors of lavender and white are reflective of the granite mountain peaks and the snow that crowns them in the winter months . . . . and are also found in the state flower, the white and lavender columbine. The brilliance of the color gold signifies the vast wealth of mineral resources to which the mining industry was attracted and on which the state's early economy was built; and the color red distinguishes the ""C"" on the state flag and signifies the red sandstone soil which gave the area its name Colorado, meaning red in Spanish.""","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/4554/"

Lieutenant Colonel the Marquis of Tullibardine, heir to the dukedom of Atholl, worked closely with local Caledonian societies in this regard to ensure that membership was strongly Scottish. The new unit wore his family tartan, and its regimental march was Atholl Highlanders. It took the form of a large battalion with companies in major Transvaal towns.

Gretna Green became famous for runaway marriages when ""irregular"" marriages were banned by law in England in 1753. Couples were able to run to Scotland and become legally married by proclamation in front of two witnesses. This form of marriage was recognised worldwide. From the middle of the 18th century these marriages were in such demand that the blacksmith, conveniently situated on the crossroads at Gretna Green, became known as the ""anvil priest"", giving birth to the anvil as the symbol of Gretna Green. Many couples are still married at the original smithy while many others, although married elsewhere, visit Gretna Green to take the traditional Scottish oath.

It was claimed that it was first recorded in 'Clans Originaux' as Murphy, but was so popular it was later renamed 'Tara' --- the first reference to that name was in 1967. See also O'Keefe. For many years the claim that this was from Clans Originaux (published in Paris in 1880) was accepted without question. In 2003 however, the Tartans Authority obtained photo copies of the contents pages of the only copy known to exist and they revealed that of the 185 tartans shown, not one of them was Irish. This 'fiction' has been absorbed into tartan history unfortunately and it will take many years to eradicate.The only copy known to exist is owned by Pendleton Mills in Portland, Oregon. Sample in STA Dalgety Collection. Interesting note in D C Stewart's Nomindex. ""This is obviously the same tartan known as Tara. During the 1977 International Gathering of the Clans in Edinburgh this sett was sold to an American visitor as being Murphy. The 'guilty' shop would appear to have been the 'Kilt Shop' in that same city. It is known that a company called Wexford Weavers were taking some Scottish tartans, changing the colours and giving them Irish names. Did they know something of Clans Originaux or, was their corruption of the Maclean of Duart, on which this is based, merely a coinicidence?""","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/5645/"

The designer's notes say: ""Red is associated with many of Calgary's teams, the Calgary Stampede and its Stampede Showband. Calgary was founded on the banks of the Bow and Elbow rivers which are represented by blue. Yellow symbolises the prairie wheatfields to the east and grey, the Rocky Mountains to the west. Black is for the gas and oil industry and white represents Calgary's pride in and symbolism of the white stetson and the White Hatter Awards. Further notes from the St Andrew-Caledonian Society of Calgary website: It is an official and registered symbol of the City of Calgary that any person can wear any way they choose, whenever they like and where ever they like. The Society is the registered owner of the Calgary tartan and is responsible for its management and promotion and has freely made this presentation to the City of Calgary . The official unveiling was 3 August 2003 on Prince's Island during the Heritage Day Opening Ceremonies where the winning designer, Donna Buie of Cochrane AB, was presented a copy of the registration, a sash and tie in the new tartan, and a cheque for $1,000. The tartan should be available in the Fall of 2002 at the Bay Downtown, the Highland Scottish Gift Shop beside Canada Olympic Park and the Scottish Shoppe on 4th Street SW. The Society will also accept requests from charitable or non-profit societies who wish to use the tartan for consideration in the future.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/5728/"

She took the cloth back to the US and at least a dress and a kilt were made from it. An interesting mystery. It's highly unlikely that if a Reid tartan existed in 1939 that it immediately sank into oblivion with no record of it remaining. Possibly the 'recommended shop' seized the opportunity to get rid of a slow selling fashion tartan on an unsuspecting visitor?

Now in the possession of Messrs Parker Knoll of Bucks. Sept 2005. BW contacted Parker Knoll family member who explained that the Mary Q of S reference was a bit of kite flying by his grandfather Tom Parker (circa 1878 -1964) who bought the chair in the 1920s, took the seat cover off to smarten it up and found an old piece of tartan covering underneath. He apparently said "" Wouldn't it be fun if we could prove that this belonged to Mary Queen of Scots?"" and thus the story was born! Parker Knoll collection sold in 1997 at Sothebys and the family managed to buy back about 170 chairs (50% of the collection) but not this particular one. A piece of the tartan was cut off circa 1950s and sent to a 'society' in Scotland which presumably is where this threadcount came from.

James, his grandfather, had moved to The North Carolina Scottish Colony of the Cape Fear River from Scotland some time between 1745 and 1765 bringing the sett with him. The relatively dry climate and local soil conditions are accredited with the remarkable preservation of sufficient portions of his great kilt to allow the reconstruction of the sett. The exhumation came about through the construction of a pond adjacent to the cemetery which necessitated the removal of 56 graves - one of which was that of George H Laing.

The name Haig possibly evolved from Norman or Norwegian history. In Scotland, the Haig name goes back at least to the time of Robert III. Around 1453 the Haig estate was divided among heirs. David Haig sold his share, changed his name to Hoge, and moved to Musselborough. Once in America, many of the Hoges changed to the now more common spelling of Hogue.

Approved by the Italian Consul in Glasgow. The design includes the colours of the Italian flag, black for the Pretorian Guard, Gold for the Roman Empire - all set against a background of Azzuri blue for the Italian national football team. The green, white, and red reflect the colours in the Italian flag. the tri-colors were adopted in honour of the uniforms worn by the Civic Militia of Milan which were predominantly green with some white. Red parts were added in 1796 when the Militia became the National Guard. The black in the Italian National Tartan reflects the Praetorian Guard. An elite force of palace guards established in the beginning of the Empire period, to guard the person and family of the Emperor. With its unique history, the guard still remains a symbol of strength and power. The gold represents the rich culture of the Roman Empire and the warmth and beauty of the Italian sunshine. These colours rest on a field of azzuro blue. The colour itself is bold and formidable, bringing forth images of the Mediterranean depths. It was selected in honour of the Italian National football team and embodies the love and support the Italian people have for their country.

In 1819, for example, the St. Fillans Society organized a full scale Highland games with piping, dancing, and athletics.

Strictly speaking it isn't a tartan and Sir Percy Sillitoe (Chief Constable of Glasgow) didn't design it - it had existed for about 100 years as an Heraldic symbol in many Scottish coats-of-arms. Highland soldiers are said to have woven white ribbons into their black hatbands, thus creating a chequered effect. Sir Percy - answering criticism that it was difficult for the public to differentiate between the police and bus conductors and other uniformed officials, introduced the three line chequered bands in 1932. The experiment was a success and the idea spread across the world with the ultimate accolade being its adoption by the European Union as the universal symbol of the police.

The grey counterpoint is a lighthearted reference to the Irish wolfhounds that Pierce O'Mahony bred. Pierce Charles Lacy O'Mahony (1850-1930) known up to 1901 as Pierce Mahony, and from 1912 also as The O'Mahony of Kerry, was an Irish Protestant nationalist, philanthropist, politician and Westminster MP. He practised as a barrister from 1898 to 1900. He was remarkable in having had successively three names, two wives and three faiths. He was honoured by the Kings of two opposing countries in the Great War. In 1903 O?Mahony travelled to Bulgaria to undertake relief work among orphans who had fled from Turkish massacres, and in 1904 opened St Patrick?s Orphanage in Sofia. On the outbreak of World War I in 1914, he unsuccessfully tried to prevent Bulgaria entering alliance with Germany, and after the war argued for Bulgaria to be exempted from war reparations. On Jan 20, 1915, he was awarded the Order of Civil Merit by Ferdinand I of Bulgaria.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/6491/"

The most famous Lermontov was Mikhail (b1814) - a much revered poet and 'dissident' who was killed in a duel in 1841. His standing in Russia was almost akin to that of Robert Burns. This tartan is based upon the MacDuff, the designer drawing upon George Lermont's home county of Fife and its literary connection in Shakespeare's MacBeth in which MacDuff was given the fictional title of Thane of Fife. The white lines on blue symbolise St Andrew - patron saint of both Russia and Scotland - and of course the Scottish flag - the saltire and celebrate the Lermontovs' Scottish ancestry. The remaining colours are from the Lermontov coat of arms registered in Russia in 1798.

The name Ontario comes from the lake of that name which has definite American Indian roots from either Onitariio meaning 'beautiful lake' or from Kanadario meaning 'sparkling or beautiful water.' Up until 2000 the accepted - but unofficial - tartan for the province appeared to be one called the Ensign of Ontario - a fairly simple sett designed back in 1965. However, championed by Bill Murdoch, member of the Ontario Parliament, a new Provincial tartan was designed in 2000 by the late Jim MacNeil, owner of Scottish Imports of Hamilton and a member of the Ontario University Foundation at Guelph. A complicated sett, it fell foul of an inaccuracy in the parliamentary private bill which resulted in a six year delay in getting it officially recognised. Colours include red and white with three shades of green and two of blue. The greens symbolise the forests and fields of Ontario and the blues depict the huge expanses of water in the province. The First Nations (Canadian Indians) of Ontario are represented by the red, and the sky over the province is depicted by white.

The Graham of Montrose tartan was therefore the obvious choice upon which to base the Longhaugh Primary School tartan. The school's colurs are green, blue and white and the central band of green bounded by blue and white is the stripe from the school tie. Red was the most popular extra colour chosen by all the children in the school, followed by purple. The broad purple bands have three lines (one each for Dundee's famous three 'Js' - jute, jam and journalism.) The colours of the Graham tartan are the same as the school's colours with the addition of black which here is shown between the two red lines and represents Dundee-based publishers D.C.Thomson's Beano comic characters - Desperate Dan (his hair, hat band, moustache and waistcoat are all black) and Dennis the Menace whose hair is black as are the hoops in his sweater. His dog Gnasher is likewise black. The year of the School's foundation (1958) is represented by the number of purple threads either side of the 'three J's' and the number of children in P4/P5 who designed the tartan was 24 - each of them commemorated by a blue thread.

The white and blue of 6713 and 6715 have been reveresed, echoing the flag and arms of Nova Scotia, founded by one of the most famous Alexanders of Menstrie - the first Earl of Stirling. The ten threads of blue are for the ten Alexanders (nine siblings and their father) who crossed the Atlantic to Virginia in 1669 and from whom most of this surname in the south of the USA are likely to have descended.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/6716/"

Also known as the The Falkirk Tartan because of the discovery of such a weave in the neck of a jar containing Roman coins buried about 260 A.D. The black and white check is woven today as a family tartan for the surname Shepherd. Notes from www.regiments.org add: ""The ""Northumberland"" tartan, also known as ""Border"", ""Border Reiver"", and ""Shepherd's Check"" predates most Scottish tartans and has long been associated with shepherds of the Border region who were encouraged to move north after the Highland clearances. As early as 1760 the Duke of Northumberland (Percy family) designated this tartan for his personal piper. It was later adopted as the plaid for pipers of The Northumberland Fusiliers, the official tartan of Northumberland County and that of the Shepherd family.

Designed to commemorate Dan Brown's hugely successful book The Da Vinci Code and to highlight the role of Rosslyn Chapel - just six miles south of Edinburgh. The tartan is based on the Sinclair tartan - it was Sir William St. Clair (third and last Prince of Orkney) who founded the Chapel in 1446. The design is unusual in that it is not symmetrical and uses the 'mystical' Divine Proportion or Golden Section to position the gold line on the Royal Purple. Also called the Golden Mean this ratio (1.61803) occurs naturally in nature and has been used by artists stretching from Ancient Greece to Da Vinci and through to modern times. The blue and white are from the Scottish flag - the Saltire - and the white further represents the human spirit and the white dove that nested in Rosslyn Chapel in the year that The Da Vinci Code film was released. The purple also pays homage to Scotland's famous heather and the red represents the legendary Rose Line - an energy line on which the Chapel is said to lie. Red is also the colour of Mary Magdalene's hair in Da Vinci's iconic painting, The Last Supper. Finally, the green takes us back to the Chapel and over 100 green men - stone gargoyles whose mouths spout ivy and vines and who were pagan, pre-Christian figures of fertility and power.

MacKessog (the Gaelic form of ?Saint? Kessog) founded a monastery on the island of Inch Tavannach and a church in Luss nearly 1,500 years ago. In his memory we have created a tartan, designed by Redshanke of Inveraray and woven on the Isle of Islay, which is exclusive to the Church and Pilgrimage Centre of Luss. The tartan is based on the Bruce sett the veneration of Kessog by King Robert the Bruce, who led his soldiers into the battle of Bannockburn in the name of the blessed Kessog, established Luss as a major pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages. The colours are : two shades of green for the hills, blue for the loch, a white stripe to create the Scottish saltire, a purple stripe for the heather and for Kessog?s ecclesiastical significance, and a red stripe for his martyrdom. The saint was murdered in AD 520 at Bandry, a small village just south of Luss. The overall tone of the tartan is beautifully muted and appropriate for a tartan in memory of a fifteen-hundred year old saint. It is appropriate both for formal wear, such as at a wedding, and for day wear with a jersey or informal jacket. All pilgrims visiting Luss and those who choose to be married here are entitled to wear the MacKessog tartan as their own.

Oromocto is also known as a community that is deeply rooted with a very diverse culture and heritage. With a population of about 9,000, it is nestled along the Oromocto and Saint John Rivers. This tartan was designed in the 1970s by Mis M Patricia Jenkins, owner of the Loomcrofters of Gagetown (Est. 1941) and the significance of the colours is as follows: blue and white represent the Oromocto and St John rivers which were used by the Indian people and the early settlers. The red and gold symbolise the British and military influence. The brown represents the early logging and shipbuilding industries and the black denotes the early military history and the first families to settle in the area. Oromocto was originally used by the Indians as a camping and burial ground and the name's origin was the Indian word wel-a-mook-took. Its meaning has several versions but the most commonly known are deep river or good river for navigation by canoe. This graphic is from the thread count supplied to John Fitzpatrick (Review of Canadian tartans July 2008) by the Mayor of Oromocto which differs from the CIDD count which is as follows: Y/12 T8 K4 W18 B12 W4 B56 W4 B12 W8 T4 Y4 K12 R/16.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/6987/"

However, following a period of consultation it was decided that the new tartan would not be adopted. There was an opportunity to use the design, which relates to the heritage and history of the Scottish Regiments and adapt it one stage further to include not only the Regiments of Scotland, but also to identify dark blue as representing the Royal Nay and in addition to feature azure blue for the Royal Airforce.

The Mackisons trace their name to St. Mackessog (Mackessan) the original patron Saint of Scotland, an Irish Missionary Bishop who settled in and around Luss and other areas of Lomondside. The Mackisons begin as residents of Menteith district and latterly were populous in Perthshire, particularly in the parish of Kilmadock. The thread-counts from the Menteith tartan have been reversed with green becoming dark blue and blue becoming green. The white in the Menteith has been, with purple, indicative of St. Mackessan?s status as a Bishop.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/7089/"

Three natural shades of brown forming a check commemorating the Falkirk tartan, dark green commemorating the Great Wood of Caledon of which part lay within the Kingdom of Gododdin, purple commemorating the Roman connection and particularly king Patern Pesrut, and dark red in remembrance of the blood shed in 604CE at Cattraeth in defence of Gododdin and Edinburgh. The princely House of Gododdin is recorded as rulers of the Kingdom of Gododdin until about 627CE when they were overrun by the Northumbrians. The kingdom of Gododdin extended from Stirling (Iudeu), through Edinburgh (Din Eidyn), Traprain Law (Dunpelder)and Trimontium to their borders with Northumbria and Strathclyde. It included the portion of the Antonine Wall where the Falkirk tartan was concealed cica 240CE. From 627CE the family became progressively scattered with groups joining Strathclyde, their relatives in Cymru (Wales)and in Lesser Britain (Brittany). The name is Brythonic and has developed in modern Welsh to GODDIN, in Brittany to GODIN and GAUDIN. Parts of the Kingdom of Gododdin are sometimes recorded as GADDIN. The name has nothing to do with the later word GOD referring to the deity, but GOD is equivalent to GAD and denotes the Old Testament tribe of that name. This reflects the Scythian descent of the Scots recorded in the Declaration of Arbroath. The name probably comes from the Sumerian silk road village called GODIN TEKE (the settlement of GODIN)cica 3,500 BC.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/7179/"

The white, blue and red are from the Russian national flag. The red on green is taken directly from the Barclay tartan and the three white lines on blue represent not only St Andrew - the patron saint of both Russia and Scotland - but also the major design element in the Lermontov tartan, the first tartan ever designed for a Russian family. The two Russian-Scottish dynasties are further connected in that in 1841 it was a Doctor Ivan Barclay of Piatigorsk who signed the death certificate of the poet Mikhail Lermontov who was tragically killed in a duel.

The predominant shades of green and coral are inspired by the council's corporate colours while blue, ivory and black are complementary and combine to create a very attractive tartan. The tartan was created to reflect the history and characteristics of the district. The green represents the Bathgate Hills where the Scottish patriot William Wallace lived and fought. The coral shade represents the shale oil bings of the 19th century shale oil industry and is also reminiscent of Linlithgow Palace fountain flowing with wine in celebration of the birth of Mary Queen of Scots. The blue represents the shimmering Linlithgow Loch and reinforces West Lothian's links to the Royal House of Stuart. The black in the tartan represents Westlothiana, or Lizzie for short, the world's oldest known reptile fossil discovered in a quarry near the West Lothian town of Bathgate, which commemorates its own strong links with Marjory, the daughter of King Robert The Bruce, in a colourful annual pageant. With many rich traditions, West Lothian has a proud heritage and much to look forward to in the future.

Tilburg uses blue and yellow as their city colours amd the tartans will be used for kilts and to decorate one or more meeting places in the town. Tilburg was traditionally known as the wool capital of the Netherlands and in the 17th century there were more than 300 looms in the city and by 1881 there were around 145 woollen mills. The industry collapsed in the 1960s and now there is but one mill remaining - AaBe.

Threadcount and sample from Lochcarron. Rationale is as follows: ""Kalvinder set out to rationalize what he wanted to express in the tartan patterns. His love for his native Scotland and his Indian heritage. For Scotland he chose the Blue. Then he wanted to recognize a famous Indian freedom fighter who was also a partial namesake. Bhagat Singh Sandhu (1907-1931). The peace that Bhagat was fighting for is represented by the color White - and Red to represent the blood that was spilled by Indian freedom fighters. Like most of us expatriate Scots we develop our patriotism after we have left the country. ( This writer had never worn a kilt nor been to a Highland Games until he came to California ). So the basic color was to be blue and white for Scotland with a red stripe denoting Indian spilled blood. So now we are looking at colors that coincidentally are also the colors of Glasgow Rangers FC . With another nod to his ethnic origins, Kalvinder acknowledged his Indian heritage by including the colors of India?s national flag - deep Saffron (Kesari) above a White center and dark Green at the bottom. The white will also have the double significance of representing the white in both the flags of Scotland and India.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/7495/"

Further research states: "" It was a Grindstone summer resident, Emily Post, who was a weaver who designed the plaid known as the Thousand Island Tartan."" Grindstone is one of the 'Thousand Islands' just across the water from Clayton. This is not thought to be the famous etiquette author Emily Post who died in 1960. Light blue is for the skies and grey granite of the islands, dark blue for the rivers, green for the trees and orange for th beautiful rainbows visible from the islands. Infromation from John Fitzpatrick's 2008 review of Canadian tartans and some US border tartans. Colours are as specified in CIDD but the graphic shown here is estimated from a poor computer graphic. JF's estimated count from a CIDD drawing is: B/40 LB6 O6 K6 LB6 RUST2 LB6 G32 RUST2 B/6. The following explanation is from Wikipedia: ""The Thousand Islands is the name of a chain of islands that straddle the U.S.-Canada border in the Saint Lawrence River as it emerges from the northeast corner of Lake Ontario. They stretch for about 50 miles (80 km) downstream from Kingston, Ontario. The Canadian islands are in the province of Ontario. The U.S. islands are in the state of New York. The islands, which number 1,865 in all, range in size from over 40 square miles (100 km?) to smaller islands occupied by a single residence, to even smaller uninhabited outcroppings of rocks that are home to migratory waterfowl. The number of islands was determined using the criteria that any island must be above water level for 365 days per year, bigger than one square foot (roughly 900 cm?), and support at least one tree or shrub. The area is very popular among vacationers, campers, and boaters, and is often referred to as the 'fresh water boating capital of the world. ""The area is frequently traveled by large freighters on their way into and out of the Great Lakes shipping lanes, but is so riddled with shoals and rocks that local navigators are hired to help the vessels travel through the hazardous waterway.""","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/7526/"

Darker tartans are recognized as being hunting tartans, and with hunting being a large part of the Inuit Culture, this is also reflected by the dark blue.

The rationale behind development of a new tartan in the name of the school was to provide a design for future incorporation into the girls? school uniform and the prefects? uniform. It was also thought appropriate to make the design available to the wider community, for example allowing past pupils the opportunity to make up a kilt or other special garment if they felt it gave relevance or a particular affiliation to their old school.

The description of the tartan from the town council is as follows: ""This tartan was created to express appreciation for the rich Scottish heritage but also the multi-ethnic roots of Saltcoats, Saskatchewan, past and present. In the 1880s the town was originally named Stirling, hence the grey in the pattern representing both the stone of Stirling Castle and homespun for the ordinary folk who peopled the area. The other colours are to represent the seasons and the flora and fauna: green for the prairie grasses and trees, yellow for the grain and fields of canola, red for the courage of the pioneers and those of the services, light blue for the wide prairie sky, dark blue for the loyalty and faithfulness of the churches and organizations that have lived out years of community service and stewardship, white for the snows of winter. Originally the design had black in it for the rich black soils found in the area but to keep the number of colours to six it was substituted with dark blue in the final weave."" If the colours mentioned are counted, it will be seen that there are actually seven in the tartan and not six as stated in the description.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/7822/"

The red lines in the moss green symbolise the ancient bloodlines running through the land and across the world and the blue with silver surround, while recalling the Saltire flag, also represent the seas that have separated us for so long.""

In 2008 Scottish authors Angus Whitson and Andrew Orr wrote a book on his exploits and designed this tartan to commemorate his life and work. The symbolism of the Sea Dog Bamse tartan is inspired principally by the colours of Norway's national flag and ensign of the Royal Norwegian Navy. Red for blood, the Viking colour, blue for the ocean and white for the snow. Those colours are mirrored in the Scottish Saltire, the Scottish national flag and in the Royal Standard of Scotland which is a red lion rampant on a gold field - Gold, also represented in the Royal Standard, is priceless, as is the value of Freedom, the gift which Bamse fought and died for. The heraldic colours of Nordkapp or North Cape, identifying Bamse's hometown of Honningsvag, are represented in Red and Gold. The heraldic crest of the Royal Burgh of Montrose is a red rose with the motto (in Latin) ""Mare ditat, Rosa decorat"" The Sea dictates, the Rose adorns. The ensigns armorial of the City of Dundee are ""Azure, a pot of three growing lilies Argent"" Three silver (white) lilies on a blue field. The tartan has been designed with the four colours of red, blue, white and gold which unite the countries and places with which Sea Dog Bamse is associated. We hope that Norwegians will adopt and wear the new tartan which honours the life of a truly remarkable wartime canine hero, whose memory remains bright in Scotland and Norway.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/7858/"

The following explanation is from Wikipedia: ""The Thousand Islands is the name of a chain of islands that straddle the U.S.-Canada border in the Saint Lawrence River as it emerges from the northeast corner of Lake Ontario. They stretch for about 50 miles (80 km) downstream from Kingston, Ontario. The Canadian islands are in the province of Ontario. The U.S. islands are in the state of New York. The islands, which number 1,865 in all, range in size from over 40 square miles (100 km?) to smaller islands occupied by a single residence, to even smaller uninhabited outcroppings of rocks that are home to migratory waterfowl. The number of islands was determined using the criteria that any island must be above water level for 365 days per year, bigger than one square foot (roughly 900 cm?), and support at least one tree or shrub. The area is very popular among vacationers, campers, and boaters, and is often referred to as the 'fresh water boating capital of the world. ""The area is frequently traveled by large freighters on their way into and out of the Great Lakes shipping lanes, but is so riddled with shoals and rocks that local navigators are hired to help the vessels travel through the hazardous waterway.""","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/8027/"

MacKessog (the Gaelic form of ?Saint? Kessog) founded a monastery on the island of Inch Tavannach and a church in Luss nearly 1,500 years ago. In his memory we have created a tartan, designed by Redshanke of Inveraray and woven on the Isle of Islay, which is exclusive to the Church and Pilgrimage Centre of Luss. The tartan is based on the Bruce sett the veneration of Kessog by King Robert the Bruce, who led his soldiers into the battle of Bannockburn in the name of the blessed Kessog, established Luss as a major pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages. The colours are : two shades of green for the hills, blue for the loch, a white stripe to create the Scottish saltire, a purple stripe for the heather and for Kessog?s ecclesiastical significance, and a red stripe for his martyrdom. The saint was murdered in AD 520 at Bandry, a small village just south of Luss. The overall tone of the tartan is beautifully muted and appropriate for a tartan in memory of a fifteen-hundred year old saint. It is appropriate both for formal wear, such as at a wedding, and for day wear with a jersey or informal jacket. All pilgrims visiting Luss and those who choose to be married here are entitled to wear the MacKessog tartan as their own. This is the standrd MacKessog tartan with the olive green changed to white and used as a special wedding tartan for those marrying in the church.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/8084/"

""The yellow stripe in the tartan represents the ""bright line"" events that forked the family into McCandlish and McCandless, namely the Jacobite Risings, and our history as a Borders family. Yellow was selected, as well as red (in the original version of the tartan), from the colors of the earliest known McCandlish blazon (coat of arms), ""Or, a galley her oars in action, and sails furled sable, flags gules; on a chief of the last three mullets argent."" The blue represents the sea, as the vast majority of McCandlishes, McCandlesses and related are among the Gaelic Diaspora, especially in North America and Australia & New Zealand, and it is again a reference to that 13th-century blazon, which features a ship. The increasing width of the black ""tram track"" stripes from 4 to 8 to 24 threads (or 2-4-12, in smaller weavings) represents the continuing worldwide growth of the name from a once very small family.""","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/8232/"

Each of the shades is symbolic. Barley: represents Robert Burns, encompassing the sett. Earth : corresponds to Robert?s father, William Burness, a gardener and builder of the cottage in which he was born in 1759. Madder : characterises Agnes Broun, the mother of Robert, her first child. Significantly warm and strong, the most important individual at this time, therefore the principal shade of the sett. Flax seed : symbolic of the four children born in the cottage. William and Agnes Burness had 7 children together, 4 male and 3 female. The male children are represented by the flax seed, the female, by the same madder shade as the mother. Based upon shades that were readily available in 1759. Madder : the most common form of a vibrant fire shade. The root of the plant would be used. Dyer?s chamomile : providing the golden barley shade, using the flower heads. The natural colour of the sheep of the period would have provided the Earth and flax shades. Woven on a 4 shaft hand loom, which is over 200 years old to techniques which would have been familiar to Burns, in a cottage built in 1723.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/8253/"

The park commemorates the sacrifices and perseverance of the Revolutionary War generation and honors the ability of citizens to pull together and overcome adversity during extraordinary times. The STA was alerted to the existance of this tartan by a handwoven version of the blanket tartan in the Jan Crook Collection. However, the woven sample was black and white whereas the blanket is said by museum staff at Valley Forge to be dark blue and cream. The cream trurns out to be ecru - natural undyed wool and it may be that what now appears blue to the museum may be a faded black..

The Magdalene Tartan registration coincides with the total eclipse of the sun on 22nd July 2009, its duration being the longest such event until the year 2132. This date ushers in the new moon of Leo within the zodiac and the eclipse takes place across India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Japan and Indonesia and ends at the Phoenix islands. The 22nd of July is the feast day of Mary Magdalene, a much maligned figure from the past but more recently venerated, as the Bride of Christ who represents a sacred female line which was rejected long ago. Jesus called her the ""Apostle to the apostles"" . . . the All. There is another mathematical significance of the 22nd . . . . when divided by 7 it gives the value of pi. The Magdalene Tartan colours are based on the 22/7 pi confluence, Black being the most prominent, this represents Magdalene's absence from view with in the Piscean era, contrary to Black we have the White and the light - knowledge that Jesus brought with his arrival. The Red is the symbol of passion Love and blood, the three Gold lines represent the pi bee energy lines that have laid dormant and reactivate post eclipse, the final colour is Gray which is the colour of the stones, they hold the truth past and present and turn the key towards solving the Grail chapter, together the colours radiate the imitative embodiment of the rising Phoenix that Revelations proclaimed and promised in 22/7.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10044/"

Among other things, the railway led to the arrival of a rich and influential Montreal bourgeoisie seeking a summer holiday retreat. These families, many of whom were Scottish or of Scottish descent, contributed significantly to the building of Canada. Bringing their lifestyle, social and sporting clubs, and churches with them, they constructed lavish homes and set up a vast infrastructure of transportation, communication and public services. This tartan commemorates their influence on the development of the City. Approved by the City authorities. Additional explanation received 30.10.09: The City of Dorval tartan is based on the history, the geography and the coat of arms of the city. The yellow/gold border represents the Fort de la Presentation and honours Sieur Bouchard dit d?Orval and all others who contributed to the evolution of Dorval. The blue reflects the colour of Lake Saint Louis and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. It also illuminates our affiliation with Quebec. The brown pays tribute to the Amerindians and recalls the bark of their canoes. The black stands for the transportation system for which Dorval is a hub: airport, railways and highways. The green evokes the parks and gardens that have replaced the farms of the first settlers and which give Dorval its charm and reputation. The red shows Dorval?s allegiance to Canada. The white is a reflection of the silver in the coat of arms. The heart of the tartan?s design embodies the City?s motto 'Ego Porta Mundi', meaning 'I am the Door of the World'.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10090/"

Its tangents include the Kansai Highland Games, started by the owner of Sin-Cos, Maud Robertson Ramsay Nomiyama in 1989 and the Ramsay Pipeband. Sin-Cos took both these projects and provided them with equipment, funding and personnel. The Kansai St Andrew's Society celebrate St Andrew's Day with a ball. Mrs Nomiyama, seeing the lack of Highland attire at the ball, bought and made kilts which she lent to ball attendees free of charge. The enthusiastic response led to the Sin-Cos Kilt Rental Service. More and more Japanese have begun to use the service for a variety of purposes (weddings, parties, shop displays and even on television).

The colours are intended to reflect the ancient hunting Matheson tartan, with the pattern suggesting elements of both the Gordon and the Matheson tartans. Interpretation of the colours: green for 'greener pastures' and blue for the sea. The family is said to have arrived in Scotland seeking a better life, and later made other sea voyages all over the world in search of the the same outcome. The black is a reference to family occupations: farmers, railroaders, blacksmiths. The purple (heather) ribbon represents the family's Scottish roots and recalls Rachael Walters, whose favourite colour was purple and who touched many people in her short life. The tartan is intended for the use of: 1) Anyone by the surname Stephen whose family originates in the north-east of Scotland 2) Descendants and relatives of William Stephen (b.1832) and Margaret Mathieson (b.1835); 3) Anyone who by way of history, marriage, or friendship has an affinity with the family.

We may never know for certain. In a Border Reivers ballad, recorded by Sir Walter Scott and others, the story is about a poor farmer Jamie Telfer. A threat to his livelihood by English raiders was averted by timely intervention of neighbouring clans, but sadly not without losses to his valiant helpers. If true, this tartan serves to commemorate our heroic distant kinsman, but in any case celebrates the instances of friendship and cooperation between clans and families - all too rare a commodity in those wild days of the Border conflicts. Structure of this tartan was evolved from the Telfer (green) and here the costs of conflict are signified with red and the thin gold line symbolises Jamie's recovery of livelihood. Other colours denote the moorland heather (purple) and wooded landscapes (green) under a blue sky, and the many burns that run (light blue) across the beautiful regions of Ettrick and Teviotdale. This tartan is for the use of all of the name of Telfer and is dedicated to all with interest in Scottish language, literature and history.

Originally used to identify troops in the midst of battle, there is doubt as to exactly when the Black Watch's unique Red Hackle was adopted by the Regiment. Whether it was first used during the American War of Independence or later during the battle of Geldermaisen campaign on January 5th, 1795, what is beyond dispute is that in 1822 the Army's Adjutant General confirmed the unique right of the 42nd Regiment (Black Watch) to wear the Red Hackle in their bonnets. In memory of Geldermeisen, the 5th January subsequently became the regimental day, and is now known as Red Hackle Day. The new tartan is based on perhaps the world's most recognised textile design, the famous Black Watch tartan, to which a series of overchecks in two shades of red has been added. It was selected from a number of designs submitted to the regimental headquarters at Balhousie Castle in Perth.

Rob Gibson is Vice-President of Brittany-Scotland Association. Developed for weaving by House of Tartan who are the sole official source for this tartan. The isle of Ushant is a small island off the Atlantic coast of France has adopted its own tartan to mark its Celtic heritage. The cloth includes black and white stripes which come from the Breton flag and red and yellow to reflect the island's crest. Designer Serge Cariou said: ""A few of us wear kilts on Ouessant, to cock a snook at outsiders as a joke. So, after a trip to Scotland, we thought 'Why not design a tartan in our island's colours'?"" Ouessant, known as Enez Eusa in Breton and Ushant in English, lies about 20 miles off the Breton peninsula, making it the most westerly inhabited territory in France. It shares Brittany's Celtic culture and traditions. The new Ouessant tartan also has blue and green elements in honour of the robes of ancient Celtic druids and bards, according to Mr Cariou. He added: ""Those are the colours of the Eussaf clan, an ancient family that gave its name to Ouessant. Jean-Yves Cozan, Ouessant regional councillor said: ""This tartan is not a gimmick, it's an act of cultural identity to assert that we have roots.""

He was the son of a tin miner and became a miner himself. After serving in World War I with the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry he migrated to Canada to work in the gold mines of northern Ontario. He fathered five children and always expressed his love of Cornwall to them. He repeatedly voiced his desire to one day return ""home"" to Redruth. In 1950, William Henry died - without realising his dream of returning to his beloved Cornwall. The colours and sett of this commemorative tartan illustrate the bright red of Canada set in five stripes to represent his children, all born in Canada. The dark red and the black stripe are in memoriam and are sett to show William Henry on the shores of Canada, eyes ever looking homeward across the seas to Cornwall. The green stripes are the shores and the blue the depths and broad expanse of the oceans between his homeland and Canada. The black and white are St. Piran's Cross, the Patron Saint of Tinners and the Cornish National Flag.

In late 1780 Major Patrick Ferguson led a British loyalist force into North Carolina to lay waste to the land of the American patriots in western North Carolina ?with fire and sword?. About half the frontiersmen who responded to this threat were of Ulster Scots (Scots Irish) background and recognized those words from their own Scottish history. Volunteer militia forces from North Carolina and Virginia assembled and rode southeast to attack Ferguson's force. They surrounded and defeated Ferguson's force which had camped on Kings Mountain, on the border between North and South Carolina. This battle was an important turning point in the Revolutionary War and helped force the British to abandon their southern campaign. The British surrendered a little more than a year later at Yorktown, Virginia.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10285/"

In addition, a line of brown was added to complement a splash of the same colour found on the bride?s dress.

The name Wright belongs to the MacIntyre Clan, Musselburgh has its own Musselburgh tartan and Sir James Maitland was the Barnton landowner in 1898. Elements of these three tartans therefore feature in this tartan. The sett is based on the MacIntyre tartan, the light blue is taken from the Musselburgh tartan and the strong overcheck taken from the Maitland tartan. Additionally every colour has its own significance: green and red are taken from the Society's logo and green reflects the golf course itself, the deep blue represents the view over the Firth of Forth and soft yellow the bunker sand.

Its primary design element is the preservation of the motif of the Blaylock family tartan: several thin stripes, centered between wider prominent stripes, on a solid field. The Hunting uses Autumn colours to remind one of the hunting season, and would be particularly suitable for casual outdoor wear. This tartan is reminiscent of the rural life of early immigrants from Scotland, including Blaylocks who settled in the Carolinas and Virginia. Some branches of the Blaylock family then migrated into western Carolina, then to Georgia and eastern Tennessee, then later to Florida and west to Oklahoma. The Blaylock Hunting may be worn by anyone with the surname Blaylock or any variation of that name - Blalock, Blalack.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10385/"

It gets its common name from its characteristic jumping display - 'pronk' in Afrikaans, meaning to boast or show off. The many different shades of green, from a very subtle green to a quite dark and mysterious green, was the starting point of this design. It resembles the fertile veld of South Africa where the Springbok grazes. The Springbok itself was the inspiration for the centre of the sett, focussing on its beautiful lustrous eyes and the white patch on its back. It also represents the rich gold found in South Africa. The name 'Springbok' has been applied to any team or individual representing South Africa in international sporting competitions and has been adopted as a nickname by a number of South African sports teams - most famously by the South African rugby team who are fondly known as ""the Boks"". It has also appeared on the emblems of the South African Air Force, the logo of South African Airways, the reverse of the Krugerrand, and the Coat of Arms of South Africa.

Linnzi Rich of Stevenson, Alabama, a junior majoring in clothing, textile and interior design, designed the tartan. ""I wanted my tartan to be easily recognized as the University?s plaid,"" Rich said of her design. ""So, naturally I wanted the predominant colors to be crimson and white, with accents of black and gray. Secondly, I wanted it to represent the entire University, so I used 13 lines to represent the 13 colleges that comprise The University of Alabama today. ""Then, in the center of the design, the innermost white square represents Denny Chimes, and the whole central plaid represents the Quad because the Quad is the heart of the campus. The four corners of the center plaid speak to our past and represent the four original buildings that survived the fire set by the Union troops during the Civil War."" Offiial colors of the University of Alabama are Crimson (RGB 153, 0, 0) and Warm Grey (RGB 238, 238, 238). For this record the official RGB codes provided by the U of A were used.

The school participates in numerous Scottish occasions, including Burns Suppers and poetry recitals, St Andrew?s day assemblies and ceilidh dancing competitions. The school will benefit from having its very own tartan which can be worn and used at these various occasions. The tartan will be woven and used to make ties, sashes, rosettes and table runners for the school. The final design reflects the children's research into the history of Mount Vernon which was an important town for the tobacco trade, originally called ?Windy Edge? and renamed Mount Vernon in honour of Admiral Edward Vernon of the Royal Navy. Colours: light blue is from the school polo shirts and the red is from the school badge; the black and white stripes recall Mount Vernon's link to the tobacco industry: the navy band symbolises the link to Admiral Edward Vernon.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10420/"

Tartan is one of the most recognisable cultural icons anywhere the world, but it is also a metaphor for interconnectedness, interdependence and diversity and thus can be used to illustrate humanity's desire for a harmonious and sustainable future. The World Peace Tartan was created as a contribution from fashion and design to promote a global message of peace. The striking wool weave has a base colour of light blue, which is representative of the presence, hope and potential of the United Nations. Scotland is represented at the heart of this enterprise through the purple and green of the Scottish thistle. The red and black in the design represent and remind us of the realities of war and violence and the great need for a new living culture of non violence.

Grey shades have been added to soften the tartan as well as to convey the gradation of colour from black to white, as seen on the Pandas' fur. The red represents China as the pandas are their gift. The number 3 signifies luck because it sounds similar to the Chinese character for birth. Where possible therefore, three red overchecks have been inserted into the heart of the design.

The Porter Drinkers' tartan may only be woven with written consent of the designer, Thomas Kinding, or his representative. Porter has been brewed in Sweden since the end of the 18th century, and in Gothenburg since 1813. Its production was stimulated by the flourishing overseas contacts of the city?s merchants. One of these merchants was David Carnegie, the grandson of George, a Captain of Bonnie Prince Charlie?s Life Guards, who took refuge in Gothenburg after the Battle of Culloden. David became a wholesale merchant and, in 1836, he bought a sugar refinery and a porter brewery. The colours of the Porter Drinkers? tartan are taken from the labels: black is an obvious allusion to the dark, full-bodied potion, while yellow might be taken as symbolic of a certain moderate sweetness. The thin red line could be interpreted as the distinct tang that Porter drinkers instantly recognize as the hallmark of a fine porter.

The contest challenged students from the department to create an innovative and symbolic tartan inspired by the history and colours of NDSU. The process encouraged students? innate interest and skill to design a tartan that represented the NDSU brand in a creative and marketable manner. In addition to creating the design, students submitted an essay explaining any research conducted, process of design, interpretation of NDSU history/colours, and an explanation of original tartan design. Faculty from the department voted on the top 10 (out of 75) designs which were narrowed down to three by a university committee. Faculty, staff, alumni, and students then participated in an online voting system to choose the winning design. According to designer Kelly Nelson, The Yellow and the Green, which is the school song, was the inspiration for the design. The song states that the yellow and green are the same colours reflected in the prairies of North Dakota, which are spacious and wonderful. In the spring, the fields are green and in the fall, they turn yellow. Yellow also stands for the bountiful grain produced in North Dakota. The unity of the yellow and shades of green and the simplicity of the design characterize both NDSU as well as North Dakota traditions.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10517/"

For Freemasons, blue recalls the Blue Lodge and the Blue Vault of Heaven. Red and blue intersect to create purple ? representing loyalty to the British monarchy, the union of the Freemasons and their concordant bodies including Scottish Rite, York rite and Job?s daughters, and the union of the original peoples and the immigrants from many countries who are now settled in Manitoba. Purple is also found in the Freemason?s Universal tartan (STR ref #1279). White represents purity and the three white stripes the virtues of truth, hope and innocence. The white stripes are also important to Freemasons, recalling the colour of the lambskin apron and the three degrees. To Manitobans white represents the pure snows of winter.

From Disney and Pixar, a new tale joins the lore when the courageous Merida (voice of Kelly Macdonald) confronts tradition and challenges destiny to change her fate. 'Brave' follows the heroic journey of Merida, a skilled archer and headstrong daughter of King Fergus (voice of Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (voice of Emma Thompson). The DunBroch Tartan was designed with subdued, rich colors to reflect the rugged, natural setting of Scotland. Representative of the tartan worn by the Royal Family in 'Brave', the pattern is neither splashy nor bright, but organically refined in its color sense. There was a concerted effort to use hues that were indicative of the less saturated dyeing techniques during the ancient period in which the fantasy film is set. The DunBroch Tartan is the original work of Pixar Animation Studios and is protected by applicable copyright and trademark laws. Only to be woven with the written consent of Disney/Pixar. Colors: Much like Scotland itself, the DunBroch Tartan is set against the ocean blue of the North Sea. The deep scarlet represents the family?s reverence for its own history, and the bloodshed lost during battles between the clans. Deep green shows a love for Scotland?s majestic highlands, where the story of Disney Pixar?s 'Brave' unfolds. Navy blue, and its clear central intersections, represents the forging of the clans within the DunBroch kingdom. And finally, the subtle gray imbues a sense of respect for the inner soul of the strong Scottish people.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10641/"

Should anyone else wish to use or wear the Elystan Glodrydd tartan, it would be considered a great compliment. The colours are based on threads used by The Cambrian Woollen Mill, Wales Registration notes: Family tartan of Llwyth Elystan Glodrydd - The 5th Royal Tribe of Wales, descendants of Welsh King and patriarch Elystan Glodrydd, from Rhwng Gwy a Hafren (Between Wye and Severn), who include the Princes of Maelienydd and Elfael and the Welsh Lords of Ceri, Buellt, Gwerthrynion and Radnor. Many families with different surnames are descended from Elystan Glodrydd. These same surnames may occur amongst the descendants of other Welsh tribal or family patriarchs, so careful investigation should be made before assuming kinship with the tribe ('Llwyth') of Elystan. The 'Elystan Glodrydd' tartan has been designed with colours that reflect the heraldry of the family, which has red, gold and white prominently displayed. The green alludes to the green hills and fields in the lands between the rivers Wye and Severn, which are themselves alluded to by the blue lines on the tartan. The tartan was created in the context of the spreading popular use and production of tartan in Wales, with many patterns being applied to generic Welsh surnames. By registering a specific tartan for the family and tribe of Elystan Glodrydd, it is hoped that people interested in displaying or wearing Welsh tartan who share descent from Elystan will therefore have their own clan/tribe/family tartan to use, whatever their surname may be.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10677/"

The club became a major component of sporting life in Shanghai during the years of the International Settlement, with teams in rugby, cricket, football and lawn bowls. Disbanded in 1942 after the Japanese invasion, it was reformed in 2012 and is once again becoming a significant feature of the expatriate sporting scene in Shanghai. All members must either be Scottish by birth or be able to demonstrate a strong connection to Scotland. The Stewart Hunting tartan was originally worn by the Scottish Regiment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corp, the military unit of the Shanghai International settlement from 1853 to 1942, and provides the base for the new design. The colours reflect Scotland and Shanghai, with the Saltire blue taking centre stage. The softer shade of blue relates to sporting team colours worn by the Shanghai Scottish members. A single white overcheck runs through the blue shades representing the Scottish Saltire flag. The Chinese flag is also represented within the design, by a single gold overcheck running through a bold red shade. Designed by Kinloch Anderson for The Shanghai Scottish Club.

Owned and operated by the Northern Lighthouse Board, the lighthouse lies on the treacherous Inchcape Rock (also called Bell Rock), 11 miles off Arbroath, on the Scottish east coast. Designed and built by John Rennie and Robert Stevenson, but regarded as essentially Robert Stevenson's greatest engineering achievement. The lighthouse stands 35 metres tall. Built with a work force of approximately 110 men, the challenges faced in its construction led to it being described as one of the 'Seven Wonders of the Industrial World'. The tartan was approved by the Northern Lighthouse Board and adopted as its official corporate tartan on 12 October 2012. The tartan design reflects the flashing lights of the lighthouse: white for the primary, white light, and red for the secondary, red light (when first put into operation the lighthouse flashed an alternating white and red light). The muted dark blue and black shades represent the treacherous dark North Sea at night. Solid black commemorates the 1000s of lives lost on Inchcape Rock as well as the men who died during the construction of the lighthouse. The geometry of the tartan creates two different impressions of the lighthouse on the horizon: when flashing white and when flashing red. When flashing white, 90 threads between the black and white represent the 90 courses of stone blocks that make up the tower. When flashing red, the lighthouse is represented at a greater distance, standing on the horizon. To build the lighthouse a number of railways were constructed on the rock to transport the massive blocks of stone. The longest railway (terminating towards the west of Inchcape Rock at Hope's Wharf) extended for 290 feet, represented in the pattern of the tartan, which has a total of 290 threads. The Right Honourable Charles Hope, Lord President of the Court of Session, initiated the building of the lighthouse in 1803, when he presented the first bill to Parliament.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10715/"

Restricted availability, please contact Kinloch Anderson regarding use. Designed by Kinloch Anderson for Melissa McNulty and her Begg family to commemorate the Begg family name. The base of the tartan design reflects an historical association with Clan Macdonald as well as Scarfskerry in Caithness where the branch of the family comes from. Inspiration for the new design was taken from the Macdonald and Sinclair (Caithness regional tartan) setts. Colours: green signifies the toil and labour of previous generations of Begg family crofters working the bleak wilds of Caithness; blue is for the sea. Working the land was simply not enough for many crofting families to survive on, and many of Melissa McNulty?s ancestors went to sea. Two in particular were, firstly, Sinclair Begg OBE, who worked his way up from cabin boy to be Master of a whaling ship and served with distinction in both World Wars. He was awarded an OBE for his actions in the Second World War, when his ship was torpedoed by Germans just off the Outer Hebrides. Sinclair Begg also went on the Antarctic Surveys of 1955-57 and became the first man to bring penguins back to the UK. Secondly, Sinclair?s older brother, John, served with Christian Salvesen Shipping as a Master Mariner during the First World War, and on two separate occasions faced down German U-Boats. In the first instance he won the DSC for himself and on the second he won the Lloyds Silver Award for Meritorious Sea Service. Purple represents the gentle heather-swept hills of Caithness which were considered ?home? for many years after the family had moved to Edinburgh. However, on a more personal note, Melissa McNulty?s Great-Grandmother, from whom her strand of the Begg blood comes, was said to have beautiful, vibrant violet-coloured eyes. This tartan represents Melissa McNulty's personal heritage and that of her remaining family.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10723/"

As a 40th anniversary project, WEG decided to design and register its own tartan, a sample of which WEG members could wear to identify them as hosting members so that seminar attendees would know who to seek out for information or assistance. The colours chosen are pink and cream the official colours of WEG, blue one of the official colours of EAC as well as for the many lakes and rivers in the province of Manitoba and yellow for the wheat grown in the province and its legendary many days of sunshine. This tartan was designed by Nicole Collette and Gillian Miller. This tartan is for the exclusive use of the Winnipeg Embroiderers? Guild (WEG) and its members. Use may be granted by written permission from the WEG Executive. Only to be woven by a supplier commissioned by the WEG Executive and authorised by way of license agreement with the WEG Executive. Strictly speaking this is not a tartan but a check - sett is far too small for a tartan. (EBW Jan 2013)","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10758/"

The tartan is universal and is for all individuals, groups and organisations associated with the UK oil industry, who want a contemporary black tartan to represent their Scottish heritage. Created by Steven Patrick Sim, inspired after learning of the historic inaugural finding of the first commercialised North Sea Oil well in 1969, in the now named offshore 'Arbroath Field'. The tartan designer himself was born in that same year, in the Scottish east coast fishing town of Arbroath. The tartan was created as a belated 40th anniversary tribute to Brendan McKeown OBE (1925-2011), the petroleum engineer famously credited with bringing ashore the UK's first sample of North Sea Oil in a pickle jar on 16 September 1969, a seminal moment in Scotland?s industrial history. Colours: the black, brown and gold together create the colour palette of raw crude oil, the gold accent also represents the iconic burning flare boom of the North Sea oil rigs; the light and dark grey stripes depict the sedimentary nature of the sea bed, the three prominent lighter grey stripes significantly represent the three castles of Aberdeen City?s coat of arms. Due to this enterprising city?s long term contribution to the development and commercialisation of North Sea Oil, it has also become known internationally as the Oil Capital of Europe. Designed by Steven Patrick Sim, copyright 2013. Woven by Lochcarron of Scotland, Selkirk. Weaving and tailoring is managed by the designer.Contact enquiries@theTartanArtisan.com.

In 2012, President Anthony J DiGiorgio advanced the idea for a unique tartan design for Winthrop University. While searching for inspiration, designer Beth Melton became aware of industrialist Andrew Carnegie?s familial ties to weaving in Scotland. Melton, a weaver, is often influenced by historical ties to textiles as well as the physicality of historic structures. Interestingly, one of Carnegie?s philanthropic efforts was the establishment of libraries, and Winthrop?s campus is home to a Carnegie library. Therefore, it is fitting that Carnegie?s Scottish weaving heritage and the physical aspects of the building made possible by his philanthropy contributed directly to Winthrop?s tartan design. Personal and institutional histories are woven together as the linear elements depicted on a blueprint of the deeply coffered ceiling and stained glass skylight of Winthrop?s Carnegie library become the defining element of Winthrop?s tartan design. Winthrop University Foundation reserve the exclusive right to grant permission to weave this tartan with the following exception: Beth Melton will retain the right to weave the design for special occasions for personal/artistic activities such as juried exhibitions & competitions, lectures and presentations and peer review publications.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10820/"

Several designs using the official WSU colours, crimson, light grey, dark grey and white were provided by CTA and AMDT students and faculty suggested changes. Nine designs were provided to the AMDT students and they selected the top six. From those six, three were selected by a committee including WSU students, alumni, community members and administrators. Those three were then made available for view and students, alumni and friends had the opportunity to vote for their choice on-line. The official WSU Cougar Tartan was unveiled during 2012 Homecoming events. Washington State University was founded in 1890 as the Washington Agricultural College and School of Science and first admitted students in 1892. In 1905 it was renamed to State College of Washington and in 1959 the name was changed to Washington State University.

The tartan is based on the sett of the Roxburgh tartan because Wojtek visited Springwood Park, Kelso owned by the Duke of Roxburgh when he arrived in Scotland. The vibrant red colour of the Roxburgh tartan reflects the Polish flag whilst the red ?ribbon-like lines? are a reminder of the red and white ribbons soldiers bought from local women to sew onto their uniforms to identify themselves as the Polish Army. The colours of the Polish flag and the Scottish flag sit together in the design to represent the special relationship between Scotland and Poland. The two shades of green reflect the countryside of the Scottish Borders and the Leslie tartan trews which were worn by the King?s Own Scottish Borderers Regiment. The single sand over-check is a reminder of the desert lands of the Middle East and of Wojtek?s soft brown fur.

Designed to celebrate Scotland's breath-taking skies, the tartan pays tribute to the Scottish rain and sunlit rainbows. Geometry and colours: The tartan's sett was designed to represent the double rainbow. Woven in seven colours of yarn the design not only effectively portrays the spectrum, but also Alexander's Dark Band, the optical phenomenon associated with rainbows named after Greek philosopher Alexander of Aphrodisias in 200 AD. The pivot of 8 grey threads represents the second bow. The blue, purple and grey shades in the weave pay tribute not only to the sky but also the waterscapes of streams, rivers and lochs. The tartan is universal and for any individual or group wanting to be represented by a rainbow themed tartan.
