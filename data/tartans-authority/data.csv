There is a strong possibility that many others wore the sett or something similar before the idea of distinctive clan tartans took hold. This tartan is worn by the present Duke of Argyll, who has approved the sett. The Black Watch is the same sett but dyed in darker shades. When used for the Argyle & Sutherland Highlanders this tartan's official designation is Gov. Tartan No. 1A (Black Watch is '1')","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/1/"

At that time the Clarks owned the Island of Ulva on the west coast of Mull. It was therefore no surprise to discover that the kilt was a very well-worn Clerke of Ulva with the black faded to brown, the azure to light grey and with old red (orange) lines on the blue rather than the crimson suggested in the original STS notes. The Clarks have subsequently had more of this tartan woven through Campbell's of Beauly and made into a kilt and trousers. (EBW).

The Highland Society of London has a Wilsons' sample but called 'Ancient Stewart'. In their 1850 book 'The Clan and Family Tartans of Scotland' William and Andrew Smith of Mauchline wrote: 'The undoubted antiquity of this pattern has induced us to give it as the 'Clan Stewart;' for in 1745 the families above named [Stewarts of Appin and Stewarts of Grandtully] were clans in every sense of the term.' STS notes: A sample of this sett was included in the Royal Tartans collection at the Scottish Tartans Society under the title `Stewart of Bute', but it is often regarded as the `Clan' tartan as distinct from the `Royal'. Captain Stuart Davidson, founder chairman of the Scottish Tartans Society, suggested that ''it belongs to the Stewarts of the Western Isles''.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/319/"

The Hunting Cumming dominates as it was the most recent family to own the estate. The single black stripe of 12 threads was replaced by the pale blue from the Innes and the yellow stripe derives from the military Gordon. It took over a year to develop and several attempts to get the right balance in the weaving, origially done by Campbells of Highland Tweed House, Beauly but the actual production went to the Border firm of D C Dalgliesh.

James Logan recorded this pattern in his book, 'The Scottish Gael' in 1831, despite receiving a different sett from the largest weaving company of the time, William Wilson and Company, Bannockburn. Wilson's MacNab survives as an alternative tartan for the clan.

It was originally thought that this tartan was possibly designed for that wedding or as a commemorative tartan for that occasion although it was not until circa 1930 that the sett first appeared in the lists of Ross and Johnston. However, research in 2003 showed that a woven sample of this tartan, just known as 'Beatrice Dress' was included in Clans Originaux published in Paris in 1880. The original hypothesis was therefore incorrect and the tartan had been in existance for at least 5 years before the wedding.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/1206/"

Stevens (a weaver in Burlington North Carolina) fashion fabric from a local outlet in Greenville SC and made himself a kilt from it. He remembered the price being about $2/yd and he bought the last piece of 15yds. He wore the kilt to the Charleston (or Savannah ?) Games and when Scotty Thompson asked him what it was, he replied ""Martin"" and ST immediately registered it with the Scottish Tartans Society and so it has remained to this day.

It bears a family resemblance to the MacLeod illustrated in the Vestiarium Scoticum in 1842 but the yellow bands are considerably narrower and there is no central red stripe. The name derives from the old lands of Rayburn in the Parish of Dunlop in Ayrshire. Undoubtedly the most famous person of the name was Sir Henry Raeburn (1756 - 1823).

The authors, the Sobieski Stuart brothers, enjoyed a popular following among the Scottish gentry in the early Victorian era, and in the spirit of the times, added mystery, romance and some spurious historical documentation to the subject of tartan. Of the better known tartans, the book offers some minor variation, but in other cases it provides the only recorded version of many tartans in use today. In 1893, D.W. Stewart said: ""in use by present MacLachlan of MacLachlan"" which is why this is often called the Chief's sett (pattern).","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/1277/"

The Clan MacInnes of the West and the Clan Innes of Moray are two separate clans. The similarity in the structure of the MacInnes green tartan and the Innes red have resulted in the use of both tartans as 'dress' and 'hunting' tartans by both clans. The notes in the archives of the Scottish Tartans Society attribute the design to the 'Onich Grocer' with no explanation . Further research by Alasdair ""MacInnes""Campbell of Fort William conincidentally offers an explanation: ""John MacInnes of Onich who was born around 1851. He was Registrar for Ballachulish and Corran of Ardgour between the years 1874 and 1920. John was also a tailor and weaver and ran a general merchant stores all in the same premsies as his Registar Office. His loom and workshop were to the rear of the building. When Edward the Seventh was the Prince of Wales he called at John's ""Nether Lochaber Stores"" to have an outfit made.

It's believed that it was first called 'Riverside Bell' and then 'American Bell' and then ""Bell of the Borders"" by Ed Bell to distinguish it from ""Bell of Blackethouse"" which was registered with STS in 1986/87. However in 1992, Lord Lyon, about to recognize a chief of Clan Bell decreed that it was desirable to reserve the name ""Blackethouse"" for the Chief. Accordingly ""Bell of Blackethouse"" was renamed ""Border Bell"" In the STS records however it was further renamed (reportedly on the instructions of Col. W.Bell mentioned above) 'Southern Bell' without any consultation with the Scottish Bell Society who regarded - and still regard it - as their official tartan. To recap, this Bell here (1489) is 'Bell of the Borders' and has a US lineage. No 370 is Border Bell and has a Scottish lineage.

Previous notes included: Designed by MacGregor-Hastie circa 1957 at the request of a customer of the Scotch House in Knightsbridge, London. The other reported Craig is said to have originated with the Earl of Mar allowing the Craigs to add the colour red to his own black and white tartan.

The Smith's sources included the findings of George Hunter, an army clothier who toured the Highlands in search of old tartans prior to 1822. The Jacobite tartan has been known since the Union of 1707 and was worn by participants in the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 and is associated with the Scots national identity. It is often worn by those with no clan connections as an alternative to a district tartan. Smith of Mauchline tells us that this pattern was taken from a scarf made in 1712 and James Grant wrote ""Doutbless it was adopted and worn as a symbol to others of secret political opinions . . ."" DC Stewart adds: ""It seems very odd that so striking a design should have been used for such a purpose, but the Jacobites were never notable for discretion . . . the story of its early associations might well be insufficient to overcome a forgivable diffidence in the prospective wearer of this as a kilt tartan.""

Although this has no official US Military recognition, it has been widely accepted by US servicemen and their families with Air Force connections as a representative design. It started life in 1988 as a new design from Strathmore and proved popular with one particular customer called Jane - for whom Strathmore made skirts in the tartan. Just like their predecessors, Wilson's of Bannockburn back in the 18th & 19th century, Strathmore gave the tartan an unofficial name - 'Lady Jane of St Cirus' - a small beachside settlement north of Montrose. Another of their customers was Robert Kulyn, proprietor of the Tartan House in Tipp City, Ohio and he showed the Lady Jane to members of the Band who like it sufficiently to adopt it. Since it was a bit of an orphan - apart from the 'Lady Jane ' skirts - Strathmore were happy to agree. Stratmore swatch & Lochcarron scarf swatch.

Dowling is clearly a variation of Stewart/Victoria. In May 2004, Phil Smith found the following notes of Bill Johnson's. "" . . .Clodagh, Dowling, Fitzpatrick . . .from a tracing of swatch in Pendleton's 'Irish Tartans' 1990 . . .Kennedy, Forde and Kiernan.""

Gretna Green became famous for runaway marriages when ""irregular"" marriages were banned by law in England in 1753. Couples were able to run to Scotland and become legally married by proclamation in front of two witnesses. This form of marriage was recognised worldwide. From the middle of the 18th century these marriages were in such demand that the blacksmith, conveniently situated on the crossroads at Gretna Green, became known as the ""anvil priest"", giving birth to the anvil as the symbol of Gretna Green. Many couples are still married at the original smithy while many others, although married elsewhere, visit Gretna Green to take the traditional Scottish oath. The Gretna Green tartan reflects the twin influences of this history and that of the powerful border clan Johnstone, so influential in this area of Dumfriesshire, on which this tartan is based.

By 1883 the unit had become kilted but had enormous difficulty in getting a standard shade for the different shipments of tartan. The Regiment thus presented a very patchy appearance on parade and the descision was taken to go over to the Government 42nd pattern. Adoption of the Lorne tartan had been out of deference to the then Marquis who was Governor-General of Canada.

Matt Newsome of the Tartans Museum in Franklin North Carolina, came across a reference to this tartan which was the winning design in a competition circa 1972 for an official city tartan. The contest was won by Barbara Schaffer with this (day) design plus a hutning one. Grey represents the lead mining, black & white for the railroad, brown for the peat extraction, the red line for the great Middleton fire of 1900 and then the red plus white representing Middleton High School. Barbara Schaffer gave one of the judges - who was from Scotland - both woven samples as souvenirs and they've never been seen since. It is thought that the tartan was never actually woven so it cannot be legitimately claimed that this is America's oldest city tartan. If it does get woven, then that's a different story.

Tens of thousands of golfers take part each year and thet tournament is continuing to expand internationally with new countries becoming involved on a regular basis. The Chairman and Founder of the Tournament is Ross Honey and therefore the tartan colours have been chosen due to the connection with the Buchanan tartan (Honey being connected to Watt and subsequently to Buchanan). The golfing link can also be tied in to the colours, green being the fairways, blue the sky, white for the balls and the honey gold for Ross Honey the founder.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/7648/"

My Cornish family and I (surname Davey), have regularly worn the Cornish National Tartan while my Scottish wife and her family (surname Brown, a sept of Clan Lamont) have traditionally worn the Lamont Tartan. The new tartan draws together our Cornish and Scottish Celtic roots. For the tartan's name I combined the Celtic-Cornish language word - 'Kernewek' (meaning 'Cornish') with my wife's family surname of 'Brown' and decided on 'Kernbrownek'.

Darker tartans are recognized as being hunting tartans, and with hunting being a large part of the Inuit Culture, this is also reflected by the dark blue. White - the use of this colour four times represents the great impact that ice and snow has upon the lifestyle in the north, while depicting the purity of the new Territory.

The Barony of Delvin was contained in the Earldom of Oxford, by Aubery de Vere, until it was broken up by Robert de Vere's Irish dominions in 1392. Viscounts Gormanston stood down on behalf of Lady Wendy DeVere Knight-Bisley in the 1990s giving assignment on behalf of her husband, so the deed of the Barony could be passed on to him, Raymond John DeVere-Austin. The DeVere family name was joined to Austin on his marriage to Wendy DeVere Knight-Bisley in 1984 and the Devere-Austin Tartan created By the Baron & Baroness. It is the present holder, Baron DeVere-Austin of Delvin, to whom the honour of taking this historic feudal title and tartan into the next millennium belongs. The Baron and Baroness De Vere-Austin, reside in Bath England and Virginia America.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/8446/"

This affinity is augmented by the clash of steel blue stripes. This strife is also silently witnessed by the sky (blue), trees (green) and the sun (gold).

The base is green as green is the Sin-Cos colour. The Sin-Cos Group was started in 1982, and named because its staff always went off at a tangent. Its tangents include the Kansai Highland Games, started by the owner of Sin-Cos, Maud Robertson Ramsay Nomiyama in 1989 and the Ramsay Pipeband. Sin-Cos took both these projects and provided them with equipment, funding and personnel. The Kansai St Andrew's Society celebrate St Andrew's Day with a ball. Mrs Nomiyama, seeing the lack of Highland attire at the ball, bought and made kilts which she lent to ball attendees free of charge. The enthusiastic response led to the Sin-Cos Kilt Rental Service. More and more Japanese have begun to use the service for a variety of purposes (weddings, parties, shop displays and even on television). Most recently the Scottish Academy, a nursery school taught to the British curriculum in Osaka, has been established to help British parents with Japanese spouses to educate their children in English.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10094/"

We may never know for certain. In a Border Reivers ballad, recorded by Sir Walter Scott and others, the story is about a poor farmer Jamie Telfer. A threat to his livelihood by English raiders was averted by timely intervention of neighbouring clans, but sadly not without losses to his valiant helpers. If true, this tartan serves to commemorate our heroic distant kinsman, but in any case celebrates the instances of friendship and cooperation between clans and families - all too rare a commodity in those wild days of the Border conflicts. Structure of this tartan was evolved from the Telfer (green) and here the costs of conflict are signified with red and the thin gold line symbolises Jamie's recovery of livelihood. Other colours denote the moorland heather (purple) and wooded landscapes (green) under a blue sky, and the many burns that run (light blue) across the beautiful regions of Ettrick and Teviotdale. This tartan is for the use of all of the name of Telfer and is dedicated to all with interest in Scottish language, literature and history.

While this tartan may be worn by any prehospital provider, three of the primary colours may be considered more symbolic of Prehospital EMS in the United States. Colours: gold, for the gold standard of care that all EMS providers should strive for; blue, for the Star of Life created by Leo R Schwartz, Chief of the EMS Branch, NHTSA; white, for the Rod of Asclepius in the centre of the Star of Life and for the common colour of many early ambulances in the United States; orange, which has an interesting history in EMS (many ambulances originally used an Omaha orange cross on a white background to designate them as an emergency unit. The Star of Life was created after the American Red Cross complained in 1973 that the orange cross too closely resembled their logo. Later, United States federal KKK-1822 Standards identified that ambulances should have, in part, a single 6 inch stripe of Omaha orange); and finally, black, which serves as a memorial to all of those that have given their lives in providing Prehospital EMS in their community.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10182/"

Kelley had climbed Crestone Peak in Colorado and returned a changed person - full of confidence. The designer of the tartan has since climbed the Crestone and it inpired this tartan. Colours: the grey and black blocks represent the strength and stability of granite in the mountain and the strength and stability of our bodies; the black and white strips represent the cracks and flaws that can appear in any mountain over time - and in human bodies, especially those affected by cancer; lavender is the official colour of cancer, and the single lavender stripe represents faith, hope, and healing.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10184/"

He was the son of a tin miner and became a miner himself. After serving in World War I with the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry he migrated to Canada to work in the gold mines of northern Ontario. He fathered five children and always expressed his love of Cornwall to them. He repeatedly voiced his desire to one day return ""home"" to Redruth. In 1950, William Henry died - without realising his dream of returning to his beloved Cornwall. The colours and sett of this commemorative tartan illustrate the bright red of Canada set in five stripes to represent his children, all born in Canada. The dark red and the black stripe are in memoriam and are sett to show William Henry on the shores of Canada, eyes ever looking homeward across the seas to Cornwall. The green stripes are the shores and the blue the depths and broad expanse of the oceans between his homeland and Canada. The black and white are St. Piran's Cross, the Patron Saint of Tinners and the Cornish National Flag. William Henry Hitchens is the maternal grandfather of the tartan designer, Eric Duane Genet, and Genet's most recent (though not exclusive) Celtic ancestor.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10251/"

GCP is about is about supporting people through transitions in their lives and about re-connecting disengaged people. Founded on work with those traditionally labelled 'homeless,' this project has been extended to adults who are facing 'deep social exclusion' and have been marginalised by lack of opportunity, skills and aspiration. Through engaging with traditional crafts, like weaving, participants have the opportunity to develop skills and increase their social networks. Working with Greyfriars kirk, the textiles class designed the Greyfriars Tartan to represent the shared history of the area. Greyfriars, now home to the congregation of Greyfriars Tollbooth and Highland, stands in grounds that had belonged to the Franciscan convent in the Grassmarket - hence the name Greyfriars. It was the first church built in Edinburgh after the Scottish Reformation. In 1638 the National Covenant was presented and signed in front of the pulpit. During Cromwell's invasion of Scotland Greyfriars was used as a barracks from 1650 to 1653. During Cromwell's invasion of Scotland Greyfriars was used as a barracks from 1650 to 1653.

After the death of Gray, Bobby reportedly guarded his grave for fourteen years, capturing the heart of the Lord Provost, William. Chambers organised for the Town Council to pay for Bobby's dog licence, and so saved him from being rounded up and destroyed.

Dr Michael Robert Young, who holds the dignity of Baron of New Abbey (or New Abbay), of which Sweetheart Abbey is the caput, commissioned the tartan to recount the story of the Abbey?s origins. The Galloway tartan has been used as the initial starting point of the design because of its direct links with both the location of the Abbey and Lady Dervorguilla, whose father was Lord of Galloway. Colours: the red reflects the embalmed heart of John de Balliol while the silver over-checks represent the elaborate silver and ivory casket. The pink shades recount Lady Dervorguilla?s romantic love for her husband. And the dusty orange appearance of the tartan provides a sense of the striking sandstone walls that confront each visitor to the Abbey.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10549/"

Owned and operated by the Northern Lighthouse Board, the lighthouse lies on the treacherous Inchcape Rock (also called Bell Rock), 11 miles off Arbroath, on the Scottish east coast. Designed and built by John Rennie and Robert Stevenson, but regarded as essentially Robert Stevenson's greatest engineering achievement. The lighthouse stands 35 metres tall. Built with a work force of approximately 110 men, the challenges faced in its construction led to it being described as one of the 'Seven Wonders of the Industrial World'. The tartan was approved by the Northern Lighthouse Board and adopted as its official corporate tartan on 12 October 2012. The tartan design reflects the flashing lights of the lighthouse: white for the primary, white light, and red for the secondary, red light (when first put into operation the lighthouse flashed an alternating white and red light). The muted dark blue and black shades represent the treacherous dark North Sea at night. Solid black commemorates the 1000s of lives lost on Inchcape Rock as well as the men who died during the construction of the lighthouse. The geometry of the tartan creates two different impressions of the lighthouse on the horizon: when flashing white and when flashing red. When flashing white, 90 threads between the black and white represent the 90 courses of stone blocks that make up the tower. When flashing red, the lighthouse is represented at a greater distance, standing on the horizon. To build the lighthouse a number of railways were constructed on the rock to transport the massive blocks of stone. The longest railway (terminating towards the west of Inchcape Rock at Hope's Wharf) extended for 290 feet, represented in the pattern of the tartan, which has a total of 290 threads. The Right Honourable Charles Hope, Lord President of the Court of Session, initiated the building of the lighthouse in 1803, when he presented the first bill to Parliament.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10715/"

Chosen as the starting point for the design, the Buchanan Tartan helps create a rich historical background with a strong relevance to Scotland. A range of marl grey tones form the base of the tartan, and colours reflecting Scotland?s scenic countryside have been added to compliment and add depth to the design. The purple tone represents the beautiful flowering heather that is scattered across the Scottish landscape and the St Andrews Links. Tom Morris won four Open Championships and his success was emulated by his son, Tommy Morris, who won a further four. These important victories have been commemorated within the design and can be seen most prominently as the four heather overchecks surrounded by four strong squares of midnight blue.","http://www.tartansauthority.com/tartan-ferret/display/10802/"

The pivot of 8 grey threads represents the second bow. The blue, purple and grey shades in the weave pay tribute not only to the sky but also the waterscapes of streams, rivers and lochs. The tartan is universal and for any individual or group wanting to be represented by a rainbow themed tartan.
