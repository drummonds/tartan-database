This tartan is worn by the present Duke of Argyll, who has approved the sett. The Black Watch is usually dyed in darker shades.","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:43:37"

It is similar to the Campbell of Argyll except for a different arrangement of black 'tramlines' on the blue stripe. The tartan may have its origin in the formation of 'Loudouns Highlanders' raised at the time of the '45 and disbanded in 1748 though a similar claim is made for another sett. The weavers, Wilson's of Bannockburn, produced many variations of the Black Watch, for the Highland regiments, by adding coloured stripes to the basic pattern. The sett was not published until 1886 when James Grant included it in 'The Tartans of the Clans of Scotland' published by W and A.K.

The Fencibles regiments were formed as a 'home guard' at the time of the Napoleonic Wars.

The Regency ended when George IV succeeded the throne in that year, the name of the tartan then becoming outdated; but production of the sett continued, as we know from specimens attached to customers' orders for more. Writers of the period tell us that the demand around 1822 for Clan tartans exceeded the authentic supply, and that not only were new setts invented but pre-existing ones acquired new names.

That right was granted to Alexander MacDonald of MacDonald whose son Godfrey is now the 8th Chief.","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:44:02"

An old kilt worn by Commander Alex Hannay (1788 - 1844) was discovered by his descendant, Miss Anne Hannay, in the family chest and came into the possession of Councillor John Hannay, a well known tartan designer and collector. He created a new design based on the old which included a red stripe. This sett was produced around 1950 by Messrs Galt of Galloway. The black and white check is a common feature of Lowland tartans, originally woven with the undyed wool and found in the earliest of tartans, the Shepherds Plaid. It is interesting to note that the colours of the armourial bearings of the Chiefly House of Hannay of Scorbie are Sable, Argent and Azure - black, silver and blue.","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:45:04"

The name derives from the old lands of Rayburn in the Parish of Dunlop in Ayrshire.

He liked the result so much that he had a bolt of cloth woven and the Cardney MacGregors have worn it ever since.

The pattern was not published until 1886 when James Grant included it in, 'The Tartans of the Clans of Scotland'. Grants version has an extra black line. The pattern is unusual in that the half sett is not reversed to create a symmetrical square. Instead the full sett is simply repeated from right to left across the cloth. There is no reliable explanation of why the Hunting Stewart should be regarded as a 'General' tartan other than, perhaps, that hunting tartans are not 'formal' wear and therefore not subject to the rigours of clan protocol. Black Watch is an equally suitable choice for a hunting tartan and is worn without regard to clan affiliation.","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:45:53"

Gretna Green became famous for runaway marriages when 'irregular' marriages were banned by law in England in 1753. Couples were able to run to Scotland and become legally married by proclamation in front of two witnesses. This form of marriage was recognised worldwide. From the middle of the 18th century these marriages were in such demand that the blacksmith, conveniently situated on the crossroads at Gretna Green, became known as the 'anvil priest', giving birth to the anvil as the symbol of Gretna Green. Many couples are still married at the original smithy while many others, although married elsewhere, visit Gretna Green to take the traditional Scottish oath. The Gretna Green tartan reflects the twin influences of this history and that of the powerful border clan Johnstone, so influential in this area of Dumfriesshire, on which this tartan is based.

This tartan is based upon the MacDuff, drawing upon George Lermont's home county of Fife. The white lines on blue symbolise St Andrew, patron saint of both Russia and Scotland and celebrate the Lermontovs Scottish ancestry.

The inspiration for this tartan came from Madam Guo Guifang, Chinese Consul General, who once spoke of the unique Scottish tartan as one of the major tourist attractions for the Chinese and suggested the idea of creating a specific tartan for the Chinese people. Designed by Heather Yellowley of the Strathmore Woollen Company of Forfar and facilitated by Angus Council and the Scottish Tartans Authority, the tartan incorporates the colours of the Scottish Saltire together with the red and yellow of the Chinese flag. These are interwoven with green bands to symbolise the great co-operation between Scottish and Chinese botanists in the Botanic Gardens of Edinburgh - home to the world's largest collection of Chinese plants outside China itself. The yellow crosses the red in five places which signifies the five stars of the Chinese Flag, the biggest and brightest being represented by the yellow cross in the middle of the red. The tartan was presented to Madam Guo on 6th April 2006 as part of the Tartan Day Celebrations which took place in the Scottish county of Angus.","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:47:49"

The Russo-Scottish tartan is based on two of Russia's most iconic figures - the poet and dissident Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov (1814-1841) and Field Marshall and Prince of the Russian Empire Michael Barclay de Tolly (1757-1818) both of whom were descendants of Scots. The red on green is taken directly from the Barclay tartan and the white on blue celebrates the cross of St Andrew - the patron saint of both Russia and Scotland. The gold and the number of white lines - three - are taken from the Lermontov tartan, the very first Russian family tartan ever designed. The red white and blue are from the Russian flag and the gold and black are from the State Arms of Russia. The two Russo-Scottish dynasties were further connected in 1841 when a Doctor Ivan Barclay of Piatigorsk signed the death certificate of Mikhail Lermontov who was tragically killed in a duel.","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:47:56"

The other colors: red and gold remind me of the brillant autumns around here. See Wells (Red)","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:48:08"

Coming from Canada, and having no real connection to County Roscommon, Ireland (where the name Hanly originates) I decided to create a family tartan. The colours are based on the Hanly family coat of arms, a green shield with a silver boar passant between two silver arrows barways, the hooves, mane and arrowheads being of gold. Having had my grandfather, father and myself serve in the military (British Army, Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Airforce respectively), I have a strong connection to the military and thus tried to incorporate the thin green stripe design from the RCAF tartan.","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:48:11"

In a Border Reivers ballad, recorded by Sir Walter Scott and others, the story is about a poor farmer Jamie Telfer. A threat to his livelihood by English raiders was averted by timely intervention of neighbouring clans, but sadly not without losses to his valiant helpers. If true, this tartan serves to commemorate our heroic distant kinsman, but in any case celebrates the instances of friendship and cooperation between clans and families - all too rare a commodity in those wild days of the Border conflicts. Structure of this tartan was evolved from the Telfer (green) and here the costs of conflict are signified with red and the thin gold line symbolises Jamie's recovery of livelihood. Other colours denote the moorland heather (purple) and wooded landscapes (green) under a blue sky, and the many burns that run (light blue) across the beautiful regions of Ettrick and Teviotdale. This tartan is for the use of all of the name of Telfer and is dedicated to all with interest in Scottish language, literature and history.

Activities include Royal Scottish Country Dance lessons and demonstrations, annual Robert Burns Dinners, a Scottish Festival, and the Thistle & Kudzu Pipes and Drums band and piping lessons. In 2010 a tartan design contest was organized to create a unique tartan that represented the Thistle and Kudzu Scottish Society. Members used an online tartan design programme (http://www.houseoftartan.co.uk/interactive/weaver/index.html) to create and submit various tartan designs that were then voted on by the Scottish dance class. The design that received the most votes was selected as the official tartan of the group. The overall design was submitted by Stephanie Bohan and the thread count established for weaving by Dorothy Harnish. Colours: dark green represents the kudzu vine which grows abundantly throughout Georgia and is well known in that state; light green, purple and white represent the thistle plant and flower in bloom.","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:48:26"

The design is based on the Royal Stewart tartan in reference to the fact that Mary Queen of Scots abdicated in favour of her son James VI whilst imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle. Sir William Bruce, who built Kinross House, deliberately set it in a designed landscape that included Loch Leven Castle. The colours used for the Fothergill tartan were specifically chosen to represent the stone from the local Cleish quarry, from which Kinross House was built, and the spectacular gardens and loch that fall within the designed landscape.

Situated on the South West corner of South Ronaldsay, this district is mainly agricultural, although its main claim to fame is that this area houses the remains of the gun emplacements which defended the RN Home Fleet in Scapa Flow during two world wars. As a consequence not only does this district have a prominent part in Orcadian history, but also for the huge numbers of ex servicemen-women who defended Scapa Flow during those wars.

Earliest known date: 22 October 2012","Designed for Melissa McNulty and her Begg family to commemorate the Begg family name. The base of the tartan design reflects an historical association with Clan Macdonald as well as Scarfskerry in Caithness where the branch of the family comes from. Inspiration for the new design was taken from the Macdonald and Sinclair (Caithness regional tartan) setts. Colours: green signifies the toil and labour of previous generations of Begg family crofters working the bleak wilds of Caithness; blue is for the sea. Working the land was simply not enough for many crofting families to survive on, and many of Melissa McNulty’s ancestors went to sea. Two in particular were, firstly, Sinclair Begg OBE, who worked his way up from cabin boy to be Master of a whaling ship and served with distinction in both World Wars. He was awarded an OBE for his actions in the Second World War, when his ship was torpedoed by Germans just off the Outer Hebrides. Sinclair Begg also went on the Antarctic Surveys of 1955-57 and became the first man to bring penguins back to the UK. Secondly, Sinclair’s older brother, John, served with Christian Salvesen Shipping as a Master Mariner during the First World War, and on two separate occasions faced down German U-Boats. In the first instance he won the DSC for himself and on the second he won the Lloyds Silver Award for Meritorious Sea Service. Purple represents the gentle heather-swept hills of Caithness which were considered ‘home’ for many years after the family had moved to Edinburgh. However, on a more personal note, Melissa McNulty’s Great-Grandmother, from whom her strand of the Begg blood comes, was said to have beautiful, vibrant violet-coloured eyes. This tartan represents Melissa McNulty's personal heritage and that of her remaining family.","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:48:34"

Hoël, king of Brittany and faithful ally of King Arthur the Bear, learns that Hélène (Lancelot du Lac's real mother) is held hostage by a giant in Mont St Michel. The night before his arrival at Mont St Michel, King Arthur has a dream in which a dragon kills a bear, which he interprets as God showing him how he will be defeated by the forces of evil. Arthur arrives too late to save Hélène but he kills the giant and avenges her. According to the legends, Arthur is injured during the battle of Camlann and, with Morgana, travels to Avalon to die. Tombélaine, in the bay of Mont St Michel is described as a gate to Avalon. There is also a connection between Arthur’s dream and a Christian myth linked to Mont St Michel: in the Apocalypse of St Jean, the Archangel of Fire, St Michael, will defeat and kill the Devil who will appear as a dragon in Mont St Michel.","Copyright © Blair Urquhart, Comrie, 2015","2016/10/31 08:48:36"
